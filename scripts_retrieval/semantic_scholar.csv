As for the black-legged tick, I. scapularis Say, global warming may also favor northward expansion of other species of medically important ticks. The aims of this study were to determine (1) current diversity and abundance of ticks of public health significance other than I. scapularis, (2) sex and age of the human population bitten by these ticks (3), and the seasonal and geographic pattern of their occurrence. From 2007 to 2015, twelve tick species other than I. scapularis were submitted in the Québec passive tick surveillance program. Of these 9243 ticks, 91.2% were Ixodes cookei, 4.1% were Dermacentor variabilis, 4.0% were Rhipicephalus sanguineus and 0.7% were Amblyomma americanum. The combined annual proportion of submitted I. cookei, D. variabilis, R. sanguineus and A. americanum ticks in passive surveillance rose from 6.1% in 2007 to 16.0% in 2015 and an annual growing trend was observed for each tick species. The number of municipalities where I. cookei ticks were acquired rose from 104 to 197 during the same period. Of the 862 people bitten by these ticks, 43.3% were I. cookei ticks removed from children aged < 10 years. These findings demonstrate the need for surveillance of all the tick species of medical importance in Québec, particularly because climate may increase their abundance and geographic ranges, increasing the risk to the public of the diseases they transmit.",2018,10,semantic_scholar

Although the mechanisms driving reproduction have been thoroughly investigated and discussed, their relative importance and possible coexistence remain an open question. Seed rain abundance and viability of balsam fir Abies balsamea, white spruce Picea glauca, and white birch Betula papyrifera were monitored during 1994–2007 along a chronosequence of developmental stages at different densities represented by four stands in the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada. The aim of the study was to verify whether seeding temporal dynamics and abundance were affected by stand density, and to test the causal relationships between the hypotheses of pollination efficiency and predator satiation. Seed rain abundance varied substantially among years and species, with the highest values being observed in 1994 and 1996, and attaining up to 28.2  103 seeds m2 year1. However, the annual dynamics of seed production was similar in the three sites with the higher densities. The greater proportions of germinating and dead seeds were observed in white birch, while balsam fir showed an average of 11.2% of damaged seeds, which were infected by larvae. The conifer species had the higher proportions of empty seeds. The causal models tested on balsam fir demonstrated that seed rain abundance influenced the amount of both viable and larval-infected seeds, although no causal relationship existed between these last two variables. The comparable and synchronous seed rain abundances observed among sites demonstrated that stand density can significantly affect the reproduction of trees, probably by limiting the access to resources, but not the annual dynamics of seeding. Pollination efficiency and predator satiation are important forces in the reproductive effort of trees and could be not mutually exclusive because both these mechanisms of natural selection synergistically coexist in driving the seeding dynamics of balsam fir.",2012,10,semantic_scholar

Coloured or red (Vulpes vulpes) and arctic (Vulpes lagopus) foxes across northern Canada are considered to be the principal maintenance or reservoir hosts of rabies virus. Therefore, I studied the phylogeography of one host, the red fox, to better understand the movement of the host and compare it with virus variant distribution across the landscape. Many studies confirm the impacts of environmental changes, particularly climate change, on the migratory behaviors of both fox and rabies virus variants. Also, different geographical areas have different population densities of red and arctic foxes. This study focused on red foxes sampled from the areas of Montreal, Abitibi-Temiscamingue, James Bay, Kuujjuarapik, Umiujaq, Inukjuak, and Kuujjuaq in Quebec, and Labrador City, North West River, Port Hope Simpson and Cartwright in Labrador. A series of 15-loci microsatellite profiles were used to genetically characterize 396 foxes and determine their phylogeographic relationships with respect to the landscape. Microsatellite markers were assessed using Micro-Checker to test for null alleles, stuttering or large allele dropout. Linkage disequilibrium among all pairs of loci was evaluated with GenePop. Genetic diversity and F-statistics was measured by using Arlequin in both loci and populations. Population structure was investigated with pairwise FST measures, Analysis of Molecular Variance, and individual clustering methods such as STRUCTURE and Geneland. FIT was significant at four loci and FST was significant at all loci indicating that the loci selected are suitable for analysis. FIS was not significant in any populations. The conclusions from the phylogeographic analysis were that there are four genetic groups of red foxes in this region of Canada, consisting of one in the Montreal area, one in James Bay, and two segregating in northern Quebec and Labrador. The Abitibi region was a mixture of the Montreal and the James Bay clusters. When a northwestern locality, Churchill NB, was included and 9-locus genotypes used, there were three distinct clusters, with Churchill dominated by one, Montreal by another and a third northeastern group prevalent in northern Quebec and Labrador. James Bay was a mixture of the Churchill cluster and the northeastern one, Abitibi- Temiscamingue was a mixture of the Montreal and the Churchill clusters, and the Churchill cluster also spread into northern Quebec and Labrador. These results suggest routes by which rabies virus could be spread via red fox movement patterns, such as along the coast, or from north to south, but also suggests a possible barrier to movement further south than Montreal. This study is important because the rabies virus is still a relevant public health concern for Canadians and, as such, research contributing to its effective eradication and control is of great importance. The results from this study will be used to inform theoretical models to help predict future rabies virus transmission and spread.",2020,10,semantic_scholar

Global warming during the 21st century could potentially increase local population densities and reinforce the pest status of this aphid in commercial fir (Abies Miller; Pinaceae) plantations in Québec, Canada. During this study, we tested the effects of a warmer environment on colony growth rates of M. abietinus and aphid morph composition during the second generation of its cycle, which is key to colony size growth and potential damage to Christmas trees. We monitored M. abietinus populations on two host fir species and one host fir variety, in order to understand the early season dynamics of this aphid and its host tree. It was possible to distinguish the two overlapping generations of winged aphids leaving colonies, which led to observing a much higher proportion of wingless daughters, produced by the stem mother, than what had previously been reported. Colony growth rates were significantly higher in a warmer environment than in the nearby plantation, suggesting that warmer temperatures in late spring and early summer may provide the suitable conditions required for M. abietinus colonies of greater density.

Yet, little is known about the disease and its ecology within Canada as few serological studies have shown exposure to the disease and fewer case studies have been reported. This report is the first to describe the molecular subtyping of F. tularensis isolates within eastern Canada using multiple‐locus variable‐number tandem‐repeat analysis. From 1998 to 2011, a total of 73 specimens were isolated from unique human and animal sources. As expected, F. tularensis subsp. tularensis AI and F. tularensis subsp. holarctica subtypes were observed, corresponding to the known geographical division within this species. The majority of human isolates (78%) and all animal (hare) isolates were of the more virulent, AI type. Half of the B isolates were isolated from patients living in a region of Quebec where muskrat densities are known to be high. A relatively high level of marker diversity was found, suggestive of multiple introductions of the organism to the region, or more likely ongoing endemicity. There was no evidence of ongoing outbreaks or transmission, and the bulk of cases were likely due to interaction between human activity and the environment (e.g. hunting/trapping activities).",2015,10,semantic_scholar

Although size displacement could not be detected when body lengths of sympatric and allopatric populations were compared, in lakes where there was a reduction in size overlap between species, the two species coexisted at relatively high densities. This contrasted with situations where convergence in size between species was accompanied by a limited abundance of one or both diaptomids.

Such habitat alterations could be worsened by spruce budworm (SBW) outbreaks. Using 6201 vegetation plots from provincial inventories conducted after the last SBW outbreak (1968–1992) in boreal forests of Québec (Canada), we investigated the influence of SBW‐caused tree defoliation and mortality on understory vegetation layers relevant to woodland caribou and its main predators. We found a positive association between severe outbreaks and the cover of most groups of understory plant species, especially in stands that were dominated by balsam fir before the outbreak, where a high canopy openness particularly benefited relatively fast‐growing deciduous plants. Such increases in early successional vegetation could provide high‐quality forage for moose, which is likely to promote higher wolf densities and increase predation pressure on caribou. SBW outbreaks may thus negatively affect woodland caribou by increasing predation risk, the main factor limiting caribou populations in managed forests. For the near future, we recommend updating the criteria used to define critical caribou habitat to consider the potential impacts of spruce budworm defoliation.",2022,10,semantic_scholar

During the spring of 1998 and 1999, we surveyed breeding waterfowl in 343 4-km2 plots distributed in the lowlands of the St. Lawrence Valley and Lac-Saint-Jean, Canada, and in agricultural areas of Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Canada. American black duck densities were higher in dairy farm and forested landscapes (>39 indicated breeding pairs [IBPs]/100 km2) than in cropland landscapes (8 IBPs/100 km2). Mallard densities were similar across all landscape types (30–43 IBPs/100 km2). Habitat modeling using data derived from satellite imagery indicated that the presence of black ducks decreased with increasing areas of corn, ploughed fields, and deciduous forests, whereas it was favored in areas where topography was undulating with slopes of 10–15%. The same parameters had the opposite effect on mallard presence. The odds of black ducks being present were doubled where mallards were present, indicating that both species seem to be attracted to areas supporting adequate habitats, which contradicts the hypothesis of competition between these 2 species to explain for recent declines in the black duck population. Results of our habitat analyses support the hypothesis that habitat changes may be a primary factor leading to these declines. Dairy farm landscapes are of great importance for black ducks, and the conversion of this type of landscape toward a cropland landscape represents a threat to an important portion of the population of this species.",2006,10,semantic_scholar

We combined multiple approaches to study the influence of plant-enemy interactions on the upper elevational range limit of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) in southeastern Québec, Canada, where a previous study had demonstrated intense seed predation just beyond the range limit. Consistent with the hypothesis of release from natural enemies at the range limit, data from both natural patterns of regeneration and from seed and seedling transplant experiments showed higher seedling densities at the range edge than in the core of the species' distribution. A growth chamber experiment manipulating soil origin and temperature indicated that this so-called ""happy edge"" was not likely caused by temperature (i.e., the possibility that climate warming has made high elevation temperatures optimal for sugar maple) or by abiotic soil factors that vary along the elevational gradient. Finally, an insect-herbivore-exclusion experiment showed that insect herbivory was a major cause of seedling mortality in the core of sugar maple's distribution, whereas seedlings transplanted at or beyond the range edge experienced minimal herbivory (i.e., enemy release). Insect herbivory did not completely explain the high levels of seedling mortality in the core of the species' distribution, suggesting that seedlings at or beyond the range edge may also experience release from pathogens. In sum, while some effects of enemies are magnified beyond range edges (e.g., seed predation), others are dampened at and beyond the range edge (e.g., insect herbivory), such that understanding the net outcome of different biotic interactions within, at and beyond the edge of distribution is critical to predicting species' responses to global change.",2016,10,semantic_scholar

Deer directly modify the composition and structure of vegetation communities, but they also indirectly affect other species of the ecosystem by modifying the structure of the vegetation. Here we review the results of a research program on overabundant white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the boreal forest of Anticosti Island (Quebec, Canada) aimed at identifying deer densities compatible with forest regeneration. Various silvicultural systems and treatments failed to regenerate deer habitat at high deer densities, but planting size-adapted seedlings could be effective at moderate densities. Using a controlled deer density experiment, we found vegetation recovery at deer densities ≤ 15 deer/km2. The same experiment revealed that other groups of organisms such as insects and birds responded favorably to a reduction of deer density. We also found that alternative successional trajectories may occur after a certain period of heavy browsing during early succession. We conclude that one of the most important remaining research gaps is the need to identify habitat-specific threshold densities at which deer impacts occur and then to design effective wildlife and forest management strategies to limit deer impacts and sustain ecosystem integrity.",2014,10,semantic_scholar

Black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.)) ecosystems are widespread across the North American boreal forest, because of ecophysiological adaptations that allowed these communities to thrive in fire-prone areas. We investigated resilience of spruce-moss forests to weather-disturbance interaction after a 3-year period (2005 to 2007) of major fire activity caused by extreme fire weather in eastern Canada. Pre- and post-fire conifer densities and environmental parameters related to seed rain, post-fire seedbeds, microclimate, and post-fire weather were measured in 133 burned stands throughout the closed-crown forest of Quebec. Critically low black spruce (BS) regeneration was observed in almost all of the stands, leading to a decrease in stand density and a shift of species dominance from BS to jack pine (Pinus banksiana (Lamb.), JP). The studied sites were characterized by thick residual organic matter, resulting in a predominance of charred duff, a seedbed associated with low water retention and high variation in temperature. While high levels of JP seedling establishment were reported on this seedbed, it was unfavorable to BS germination and survival in the context of warm and dry weather that prevailed in post-fire summers. In these ecosystems, early vegetation establishment patterns are generally reliable predictors of future stand composition and the exclusion of BS will presumably be maintained through succession. During large fire years, high proportions of the landscape are subjected to the interaction of fire regime and weather that creates unsuitable conditions for BS regeneration. Hence, vegetation change is susceptible to happen at a broad scale. Therefore, the frequency of major fire years could have a decisive influence on the rate of vegetation response to climate change in this biome.",2013,10,semantic_scholar

The composition of AM fungus species from strawberry field soils did not perfectly match the fungus populations recovered from the root-initiated successive trap cultures. The study detected ten AM fungus species, half of which were found in trap cultures but not in the field soil samples. AMF species displayed different sporulation patterns with varying spore densities depending on the sample sites, the number of trap culture cycles, and the bait host plant. Glomus mosseaeand G. macrocarpumwere detected at two of the three sampling sites, across all of the trap cultures, regardless of the test plant involved.

It is also mandatory for the evaluation of production costs aimed at profitable farm operations, especially when land-based recirculation technology is the favoured rearing strategy. Spotted wolfish is a promising marine fish species and a candidate species in Quebec, Canada. Wolffishes displays strong domestication traits including a “low-stressed” behaviour. Reports on the physiological responses to stressors of spotted wolffish are scarce and stocking density recommendations for small size fish (range of 50-200g) are not yet available. A first trial evaluated the growth response of 50-100g juvenile wolffish to increasing densities (10, 20 and 40 Kg· m in duplicates) in order to identify the preferred range of density to evaluate more closely. A second trial was conducted in triplicates at fixed densities (20, 30 and 40 Kg· m) on 100-170g fish. Growth was only slightly impaired in the increasing densities trial where final densities reached >50 Kg· m. Acute stress challenge tests were conducted at the end of the growth trials. Cortisol, ionic composition, HSI, hematocrit, plasma protein and water content (liver and muscle), lysozyme activity were measured. Sedentary life-style of the spotted wolffish (sluggish swimmers and bottom occupancy) is a possible explanation for the observed weak primary, secondary and tertiary stress responses but most likely wolffishes can be considered highly resistant to stress and crowding conditions.",2010,10,semantic_scholar

The seedbeds following salvage were, on average, more hospitable to germination, but, incongruously, engendered far lower regeneration densities. The poor recruitment on salvaged sites was due primarily to the loss of seeds following the immediate post-fire salvage, when cone-bearing branches were removed along with the trunks. By contrast, the density of the asexually-recruited Populus tremuloides was relatively unaffected.

We hypothesized that top-down dominance of moose could also occur further north in undisturbed boreal forest where densities generally reach less than 0.1 moose x km-2. 
 
(2) Summer forage production (leaves of shrubs and trees) averaged only 17 kg x ha-1 in our 3090 km2 study area, whereas it ranged between 144 and 241 kg x ha-1 in the core of moose range in the Quebec-Labrador peninsula. Annual production of preferred winter forage (twigs of deciduous shrubs and trees) was also very low in the study area, contrary to that of the evergreen balsam fir, whose availability was comparable to that measured in southern ranges. 
 
(3) Low forage production in the study area was due to a high proportion of outcrops (17%) and open black spruce stands (20%), and to the old age of most forest stands. 
 
(4) Forage had a patchy distribution: production of leaves in the most productive habitat type, deciduous stands, exceeded by 22 times that measured in the coniferous stands. Forage distribution influenced habitat use by moose, which generally showed year-round preferences for forage-rich mixed and deciduous stands and resulted in large home ranges. 
 
(5) Balsam fir dominated moose diets in late winter, whereas this plant species represented only 17-19% of forage consumed further south in the moose range. We hypothesized that heavy consumption of balsam fir negatively affected the energy balance of moose in winter. 
 
(6) Monitored females produced only 78 calves: 100 cows, during three consecutive years. This relatively low rate of calf production could be related to suboptimal nutrition in winter and in summer. We found a significant relationship between snow depth, summer temperature, and lactation rate, an index to cow:calf ratios in autumn. Lactation rate was more strongly related to weather of the preceding year than that of the current one, suggesting that weather had an immediate influence on body reserves of dams, but little impact on calf production until the next year. 
 
(7) Calves experienced high survival, particularly during their first summer of life (90%), in contrast with southern moose populations exposed to higher predation pressure. Annual survival of adult females (87%) exceeded that of males (74%) because the latter were more vulnerable to hunting. Natural mortality was similar in both sexes, 8-10%. In adults, predation may have been lighter, and other natural mortality causes higher in the study area than in the core of the moose range.

However, in the last thirty years, irruptions of vole predators such as owls have been reported by ornithologists south of the North American boreal forest. While such southerly irruptions have been associated in Fennoscandia with periods of low abundance of small mammals within their usual distribution range, their possible cyclic nature and their relationships to fluctuations in vole densities at northern latitudes has not yet been demonstrated in North America. With information collected from existing data-bases, we examined the presence of cycles in small mammals and their main avian predators by using temporal autocorrelation analyses. Winter invasions of boreal owls (Aegolius funereus) were periodic, with a 4-yr cycle in Quebec. Populations of one species of small mammal, the red-backed vole (Clethrionomys gapperi), fluctuated periodically in boreal forests of Quebec (north to 48°N). Boreal owls show invasion cycles which correspond to years of low density of red-backed voles, the main food item for this owl species. In addition, winter observations of northern hawk owls (Surnia ulula) and great gray owls (Strix nebulosa) south of their usual range increased in years of low density of red-backed voles. Our results suggest that a 4-yr population cycle exists in the eastern boreal forest of North America for voles and owls, which is very similar to the one observed in Fennoscandia.",2004,10,semantic_scholar

We assessed the temporal trajectories of the herbaceous communities in Abies balsamea (L.)

The impact of deer exclusion or reduction to 7.5 and 15 deer·km-2 was compared with benchmark in situ deer densities (27 and 56 deer·km-2). Effects of deer management treatments on plant species and functional trait assemblages over time were assessed using principal response curves. Although complete deer exclusion seemed necessary to modify species composition from that occurring under intense browsing, a reduced density of 7.5 deer·km-2 was sufficient to induce significant changes in functional trait assemblages of regenerating stands. For instance, reduced deer densities favored plants with brightly colored flowers and compound inflorescences pollinated by animals and producing large seeds and fleshy fruits dispersed by animals.

(Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) by Trichogramma minutum Riley (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) was recorded in several host populations during the rising phase of an outbreak in the Gatineau Valley (Quebec, Canada) in 1999 and 2000. Some of the observed spruce budworm populations were subjected to experimental aerial applications of Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki during the course of the study. Untreated spruce budworm population densities at the onset of the study were directly related to stand composition (the proportion of non‐host basal area) but unrelated to plant species diversity. Much of the variation in budworm egg mass parasitism rates was accounted for (77.1% of total variance) by three variables: year, spruce budworm egg population density, and proportion of non‐host basal area in the stand. The exploitation of eggs within parasitised egg masses was related to year, B. thuringiensis treatment, egg mass size, and the proportion of egg masses parasitised in the host population (76.9% of variance). The yearly variation in parasitism rate was considerable, and was consistent with climatic conditions, namely heat accumulation and precipitation during the spruce budworm oviposition period. Parasitism by T. minutum on eggs of C. fumiferana was recorded in 16 additional sites in 2000, to confirm the general form of the inverse density dependence of parasitism. Observations recorded by Neilson in the Green River area of New Brunswick (Canada) between 1948 and 1957 are discussed in the context of the present analysis.

Research has shown that the establishment and development of oak seedlings prior to overstory removal, commonly referred to as advanced regeneration, is crucial for retaining oak species in the regenerated stand. The shelterwood reproduction method has been suggested as a means of developing the advance regeneration needed. In 1983, various shelterwood treatments were evaluated on the Fernow Experimental Forest in north-central West Virginia. Three overstory and two understory densities resulting in six treatment combinations were studied. Advanced red oak (Quercus rubra) regeneration was not abundant before treatment over most of the study area. Both natural regeneration and planted northern red oak and white ash (Fraxinus americana) seedlings were evaluated. Growth of planted seedlings was not significant after 5 years, though survival of red oak was improved significantly by both overstory and understory treatments. Natural regeneration of red oak was inadequate to recommend further overstory removal, and did not differ significantly by treatment combination. Overstory treatments stimulated abundant sweet birch (Betula lenta) regeneration, reducing the chances of establishing oak in the future. These results suggest that forest managers in the central Appalachian region may be unable to establish or develop advance regeneration of sufficient size and quantity when attempting to regenerate oaks on mesic sites with the shelterwood method as implemented here.",1995,10,semantic_scholar

The random encounter model (REM) is a camera‐trap method that has been developed to estimate population densities using unmarked individuals. However, few studies have evaluated its reliability in the field, especially considering that this method relies on parameters obtained from collared animals (i.e., average speed, in km/h), which can be difficult to acquire at low cost and effort. Our objectives were to (1) assess the reliability of this camera‐trap method and (2) evaluate the influence of parameters coming from different populations on density estimates. We estimated a reference density of black bears (Ursus americanus) in Forillon National Park (Québec, Canada) using a spatial capture–recapture estimator based on hair‐snag stations. We calculated average speed using telemetry data acquired from four different bear populations located outside our study area and estimated densities using the REM. The reference density, determined with a Bayesian spatial capture–recapture model, was 2.87 individuals/10km2 [95% CI: 2.41–3.45], which was slightly lower (although not significatively different) than the different densities estimated using REM (ranging from 4.06–5.38 bears/10km2 depending on the average speed value used). Average speed values obtained from different populations had minor impacts on REM estimates when the difference in average speed between populations was low. Bias in speed values for slow‐moving species had more influence on REM density estimates than for fast‐moving species. We pointed out that a potential overestimation of density occurs when average speed is underestimated, that is, using GPS telemetry locations with large fix‐rate intervals. Our study suggests that REM could be an affordable alternative to conventional spatial capture–recapture, but highlights the need for further research to control for potential bias associated with speed values determined using GPS telemetry data.",2021,10,semantic_scholar

Carabid beetles were sampled in six to seven fields from June to September 2004 and 2005 using pitfall traps. A total of 33 species from 15 genera were identified, with the exotic Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger) (Coleoptera: Carabidae), representing 75.8% and 84.5% of all individuals trapped in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Large variations in species richness and diversity indexes were observed between fields within and between years. Multivariate analyses showed that carabid activity-density varied as a function of field location and sampling period, with individuals belonging to species overwintering as adults being more abundant early in the growing season. There was no relationship between carabid trap catches and A. glycines density, suggesting that carabid beetles do not respond numerically to soybean aphid populations at the spatial scale studied.

However, detailed population dynamics studies are hard to conduct in low-density, pre-outbreak populations because the insects are difficult to sample in sufficient numbers. Using laboratory-raised larvae installed in the field across a 1,000 km east-west gradient in Québec (Canada) over an 11-yr period, we examined if parasitism and predation were likely to explain fluctuations in low-density spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana; SBW) populations. Parasitism rates by the two main larval parasitoid species, Elachertus cacoeciae and Tranosema rostrale, peaked during different years. This suggests that temporal fluctuations in overall parasitism were partly buffered by compensatory dynamics among parasitoid species. Still, spatial covariance analyses indicate that the residual interannual variation in parasitism rates was substantial and correlated over large distances (up to 700 km). On the other hand, interannual variation in predation rates was not spatially correlated. Piecewise structural equation models indicate that temporal variation in parasitism and predation does not influence temporal variation in wild SBW abundance. Spatially, however, SBWs installed in warmer locations tended to show higher parasitism rates, and these higher rates correlated with lower wild SBW population levels. Overall, the results indicate that large-scale drops in parasitism occur and could potentially contribute to SBW population increases. However, during the period covered by this study, other factors such as direct effects of weather on SBW larval development or indirect effects through host tree physiology or phenology were more likely to explain large-scale variation in wild SBW populations.",2018,10,semantic_scholar

Since their introduction on Anticosti Island (Québec) in the late 1890s, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have had detrimental effects on preferred forage species. To determine the impact of deer browsing on tree growth and forest structure, we compared stem density, age, and size of conifer species across a range of open, semi-forested, and forest stands, where browsing severity on balsam fir (Abies balsamea), a preferred species, was variable. Most balsam fir saplings showed signs of browsing, with maximum impact at low sapling density. At most stands, balsam fir saplings were smaller than white spruce (Picea glauca) and black spruce (Picea mariana) saplings and developed bonsai-like growth forms. Browsing was light on white spruce; no browsing was recorded on black spruce. Tree-ring analysis was used to differentiate the influence of deer browsing from the possible effects of past insect activity on conifer species. Periods of radial growth reduction coincided with documented spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) and hemlock looper (Lambdina fiscellaria) infestations during the 20th century. The combined influence of insect defoliation and deer browsing on fir was evidenced by contrasted patterns in stem growth above and below browsing height. Balsam fir sapling mortality in the 1980s and early 1990s was likely due to severe deer browsing rather than insect defoliation. Reduced sapling growth and recruitment of balsam fir to the canopy will likely modify the forest composition from balsam fir- to white spruce-dominated stands.",2005,10,semantic_scholar

Under humid climate, used covers are mainly oxygen barrier covers. Their performance is based on the maintenance of a high level of water saturation in cover layers that decreases oxygen ingress down to reactive mine wastes. After mine closure, natural colonisation of plant species adapted to current climate conditions takes place gradually on the covers. Plants, especially trees with deep rooting, can affect the water balance of the cover materials. If water saturation decreases in cover materials due to root colonisation, it can cause oxygen ingress to the mine wastes. Numerical models used to predict cover water balance integrate vegetation effects mainly through the use of leaf area index (LAI), root maximal depth (Rtmax), and root length density (RLD) as input parameters. By 2100, a northward shift of the distribution of some tree species is predicted from temperate to boreal regions of Canada because of climate change (CC). 
In this paper, the Lorraine abandoned mine site reclaimed with a cover with capillary barrier effect (CCBE) and surrounded by a boreal mixed wood forest was used as a case study. CC projections, woody species inventories, and bibliographical research of tree species distribution changes and associated values of key parameters were conducted. All the information collected, along with CC projection data, has helped anticipate potential effects on cover water balance components in the context of CC for the Quebec region. At the Lorraine mine site, future dominance of shallow- and medium-rooted deciduous tree species and decline of shallow- and deep-rooted coniferous tree species with CC will have impacts on the CCBE water balance. Further insights are needed to model and integrate potential effects of CC on the evolution of LAI, Rtmax and RLD values of shallow-, medium- and deep-rooted species when assessing the efficiency of mine reclamation cover design over the long term. Preventive and/or remedial measures may be required to prevent cover performance decrease due to tree colonisation.",2019,10,semantic_scholar

However, competition for acquiring N as well as specific interactions between blueberry and companion weeds characterized by contrasted functional traits remain poorly documented. Here, we assessed fertilizer-derived N acquisition efficiency and biomass production in lowbush blueberry and two common weed species that have different functional traits—sweet fern (Comptonia peregrina), a N2-fixing shrub, and poverty oat grass (Danthonia spicata), a perennial grass—in a commercial blueberry field in Québec, Canada. In 2015, 15N-labelled ammonium sulfate was applied at a rate of 45 kg ha-1 to 1 m2 field plots containing lowbush blueberry and one of the two weeds present at several different density levels (0 to 25 plants m-2). In 2016, each plot was harvested to determine vegetative biomass and the percentage of fertilizer-derived N recovered (PFNR) in each species. The PFNR was higher in blueberry (24.4 ± 9.3%) than in sweet fern (13.4 ± 2.6%) and poverty oat grass (3.3 ± 2.9%). However, lowbush blueberry required about four times more root biomass than sweet fern and poverty oat grass to uptake an equivalent amount of N from ammonium sulfate. The PFNR in poverty oat grass increased with plant density (from 0.8% to 6.4% at 2–3 and >6 plants m-2, respectively), which resulted in a decrease in blueberry’s PFNR (from 26.0 ± 1.4% to 8.6 ± 1.8%) and aboveground vegetative biomass production (from 152 ± 58 to 80 ± 28 g m-2). The increase in biomass production and N content in sweet fern with increasing plant density was not accompanied by an increase in PFNR (29.7 ± 8.4%), suggesting an increasing contribution of atmospherically-derived N. This mechanism (i.e., N sparing) likely explained blueberry’s higher biomass production and N concentration in association with sweet fern than with poverty oat grass. Overall, our study confirms lowbush blueberry low efficiency (on a mass basis) at taking up N derived from the fertilizer as compared to weeds and reveals contrasted and complex interactions between blueberry and both weed species. Our results also suggest that the use of herbicides may not be necessary when poverty oat grass is present at a low density (<15 plants of poverty oat grass m-2) and that adding inorganic N fertilizer is counterproductive when this species is present at a high density as it takes up as much fertilizer as lowbush blueberry.",2019,10,semantic_scholar

This study was conducted from 2003 and 2004 on four golf courses located in the Quebec City area (Canada) with the objectives to identity Tipulidae assemblages to species level and to determine the spatial distribution and temporal occurrence of the ECF. Larvae, pupae and adults were scouted weekly from May to early Oct. A total of 35 species of Tipulidae,' representing four genera, were identified. Two new species were recorded for Quebec, Nephrotoma cornicina L., and the Marsh crane fly Tipula oleracea L. ECF was the predominant species found on all sites, accounting for 43-92% of the total number of specimens collected at each golf course. ECF completed one generation per year. In our study, the fourth larval instar was sampled from mid-May to early Sept and adult peak emergence occurred during mid-Sept. Larval density varied among golf course management areas, with larvae being uncommon on tees and greens and most abundant on roughs. A principal component analysis using varimax rotation showed that larval abundance was positively related to silt, clay, Ca, Cu, K, and Mg, and negatively related to sand and uncompressed thatch thickness.

A conceptual model for the coexistence of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and American beech (Fagus grandibfolia) has been proposed, based on a low-light survival/high-light growth trade-off, which interacts with soil fertility and small-scale spatiotemporal variation in the environment. In this study, we first tested whether the spatial distribution of seedlings and saplings can be predicted by the spatiotemporal variability of light availability and soil fertility, and second, the manner in which the process of environmental filtering changes with regeneration size. We evaluate the support for this hypothesis relative to the one for a neutral model, i.e., for seed rain density predicted from the distribution of adult trees. To do so, we performed intensive sampling over 86 quadrats (5 x 5 m) in a 0.24-ha plot in a mature maple-beech community in Quebec, Canada. Maple and beech abundance, soil characteristics, light availability, and growth history (used as a proxy for spatiotemporal variation in light availability) were finely measured to model variation in sapling composition across different size classes. Results indicate that the variables selected to model species distribution do effectively change with size, but not as predicted by the conceptual model. Our results show that variability in the environment is not sufficient to differentiate these species' distributions in space. Although species differ in their spatial distribution in the small size classes, they tend to correlate at the larger size class in which recruitment occurs. Overall, the results are not supportive of a model of coexistence based on small-scale variations in the environment. We propose that, at the scale of a local stand, the lack of fit of the model could result from the high similarity of species in the range of environmental conditions encountered, and we suggest that coexistence would be stable only at larger spatial scales at which variability in the environment is greater.",2008,10,semantic_scholar

The mineral arose through the interaction of highly fractionated, hyperagpaitic fluids with sodalite syenite xenoliths. Martinite develops both as single crystals and as rosettes of triangular to roughly hexagonal plates varying from 50 μm to a maximum of about 1 mm across. Individual crystals are typically 2− x S minerals (UK55 group), UK53a, UK73, UK82, UK91 and a lollingite-like mineral.

The structure of martinite has been refined to R = 6.30, wR 2 = 13.82%. The mineral is strongly layered, with sheets of tetrahedra ( T ), octahedra ( O ) and interlayer cations ( X ). The T layers are composed of six-membered rings of SiO 4 tetrahedra linked by [(Si,B)]O 4 and (BO 4 ) tetrahedra. The sheets of octahedra are composed of edge-sharing M ϕ 6 octahedra ( M : Na,Ca; ϕ: unspecified ligand) arranged in a closest-packed arrangement. The O sheets are effectively sandwiched between two symmetrically equivalent T layers ( T 2 , & T macr; 2 ), producing a strongly bonded T – O – T unit. The interlayer component ( X ) houses poorly ordered Na polyhedra and H 2 O molecules. Stacking of these principal components perpendicular to [001] results in a OT 2 X & T macr; 2 O module.

It is associated with albite, aegirine, natrolite, gonnardite, siderite, petersenite-(Ce), franconite, dawsonite, analcime, quartz, eudidymite, catapleiite, gaidonnayite, monazite-(Ce), calcite, adamsite-(Y), shomiokite- (Y), galena, sphalerite and rutile in cavities; earlier minerals are microcline, nepheline, annite, sodalite and zircon. Niveolanite occurs as soft fibrous (random, matted, radiating, subparallel, sheaf- or spray-like) aggregates up to 2 cm consisting of fibers up to 1.4 cm long and 0.01 mm thick. Rarely, aggregates of acicular crystals up to 1 cm long and 0.03 mm thick, elongate along [001], with a tetragonal or octagonal cross-section, and fibrous pseudomorphs after eudidymite are observed. Individual crystals of niveolanite are colorless and transparent. Aggregates are snow-white to pearl-white, with a silky luster. The density calculated for the empirical formula with 1.66 H 2 O pfu is 2.06, whereas that for the less hydrous variety (1 H 2 O pfu ) is 1.82 g/cm 3 . Niveolanite is optically uniaxial positive, ω 1.469(1), e 1.502(1). The IR spectrum is unique. The averaged chemical composition (Na, K and Ca were determined by electron microprobe, Be by ICP–OES, [CO 2 + H 2 O] from loss on ignition, CO 2 by selective absorption) is: Na 2 O 19.81, K 2 O 0.07, CaO 3.88, BeO 16.65, CO 2 29.81, H 2 O 26.93, total 97.15 wt.%. The empirical formula calculated for 1 C apfu is: (Na 0.94 Ca 0.10 ) ∑1.04 Be 0.98 (CO 3 ) 1.00 (OH) 1.10 ·1.66H 2 O. In moist air, niveolanite strongly absorbs molecular water; the process of its hydration–dehydration is easily reversible. Niveolanite is tetragonal, P 4/ mcc , a 13.1304(19), c 5.4189(11) A, V 934.3(3) A 3 , Z = 8.

The crystal structure was solved using a single crystal and synchrotron radiation, R = 0.0358. Niveolanite represents a new structure-type. Its structure includes isolated, infinite chains of BeO 2 (OH) 2 tetrahedra linked via common OH groups; two other vertices of each Be tetrahedron are shared with (CO 3 ) groups, and Na cations occupy seven-fold polyhedra [NaO 6 (H 2 O)] forming columns. Chains of Be tetrahedra and columns of Na polyhedra are aligned along the c axis, just as broad channels in which H 2 O molecules are located. The structural formula is: {(Na 0.9 Ca 0.1 )[(H 2 O) 0.9 (OH) 0.1 ]}{Be(OH)} (CO 3 )·0–1H 2 O. The idealized formula is: NaBe(CO 3 )(OH)·1–2H 2 O. The mineral was named from Latin niveus , snow-white, and lana , wool, alluding to the visual similarity of its aggregates to snow-white, fluffy flocks of wool.

Here, we assessed the resilience of a forest ecosystem to an overabundant herbivore population by assessing changes in 19 functional traits for plant, 13 traits for ground beetle and 16 traits for songbird communities after six years of controlled browsing on Anticosti Island (Quebec, Canada). Our results indicated that plants were more responsive to 6 years of reduced browsing pressure than ground beetles and songbirds. However, co-inertia analysis revealed that ground beetle communities responded in a similar way than plant communities with stronger relationships between plant and ground beetle traits at reduced deer density, a pattern not detected between plant and songbird. High deer density favored plants species that reproduce vegetatively and with abiotic pollination and seed dispersal, traits implying little interaction with animal. On the other hand, traits found at reduced deer density mostly involved trophic interaction. For example, plants in this treatment had fleshy fruits and large seeds dispersed by birds or other animals whereas ground beetle species were carnivorous. Overall, our results suggest that plant communities recovered some functional components to overabundant herbivore populations, since most traits associated with undisturbed forests were reestablished after six years of deer reduction. The re-establishment of functional plant communities with traits involving trophic interaction induces changes in the ground-beetle trait community, but forest structure remains likely insufficiently heterogeneous to shift the songbird trait community within six years.",2014,10,semantic_scholar

Two attributes of the vegetation, the amount of aboveground biomass (in grams) and the proportion of the vegetation composed of obligate perennial species, predicted 76% of the variation in species density. The success of the predictor variables suggests that competitive intensity, as reflected in biomass levels, and the time elapsed since the last disturbance event, as reflected in the proportion of the vegetation composed of obligate perennials, are important determinants of local variation in species density. The model was then tested against independent data from shoreline vegetation in southeastern Ontario, Canada.

Windthrow occurrence was highest when deposit was thick (more than 1m) and slope class was medium (from 15 to 30 per cent). Finally, this study has shown the importance of partial windthrow at the landscape scale in the North Shore region.

Trees invest in both primary (e.g. height) and secondary (e.g. diameter) growth. The trade-off between these investments varies between species and changes with the tree growing environment. To better establish this trade-off, readily available allometric exponents relating height to diameter at breast height (γ(h,dbh)) and stem volume to diameter at breast height (α(v,dbh)) were simultaneously studied.


METHODS
Allometric exponents α(v,dbh) and γ(h,dbh) were obtained from 8893 individual tree stem analyses from two broadleaved species (Betula papyrifera, Populus tremuloides) and four conifers (Picea glauca, Picea mariana, Pinus banksiana, Abies balsamea) in the temperate and boreal forests of the province of Quebec, Canada. α(v,dbh) and γ(h,dbh) were related to tree age, stand density index (SDI), and mean temperature (TGS) and total precipitation (PGS) of the growing season.


KEY RESULTS
α(v,dbh) and γ(h,dbh) were found to be invariant with PGS and positively related to SDI and TGS for all species except Pinus banksiana. The parameter values associated with SDI and TGS were of higher value for conifers than for broadleaved species.


CONCLUSIONS
This suggests that conifers and broadleaved species have different growth patterns. This could be explained by their different mode of development, the conifer species having a stronger apical dominance than broadleaved species. Such results could be further considered in allocation studies to quantify future carbon stocks in managed forests.",2016,10,semantic_scholar

In this study, I estimated the relative causal effects of several environmental variables known to influence diversity and productivity in plant communities. Two sites differing in disturbance intensity (i.e. wrack deposition) were studied along a saltwater lagoon, at iles de la Madeleine, Quebec, Canada. A larger proportion of the variance in species density (82%) and plant cover (81%) was explained by the environmental factors at the most disturbed site, while only 35% of the variance in species density and 47% of the variance in plant cover were explained at the other, less disturbed site. At the most disturbed site, environmental factors associated with distance from the shoreline (e.g. salinity, anoxia, granulometry) indirectly controlled species density through their effects on plant cover, while at the less disturbed site, environmental factors influenced both plant cover and species density. At low disturbance intensity, the species pool may be more significant than productivity per se in restricting local diversity: however, at higher intensity of disturbance, productivity (directly influenced by resources and abiotic conditions) may be more important in controlling diversity.",2005,10,semantic_scholar

It can be used to harvest short-rotation woody crop plantations such as willow or hybrid poplar. It can also be used to clear wild brush, forest understory, and encroaching small trees to improve land management. A commercial version of the biobaler was evaluated for the latter purpose, i.e., to harvest natural shrubs in various environments in central Canada (at three sites in Quebec and two sites in Ontario) and in mid-western United States (at seven sites in Minnesota). More than 250 bales were harvested and monitored on natural stands in 2009 and 2010 to gain information on machinery management under wide-ranging conditions of crop species, density, and soil conditions. The harvest rate ranged from 2 to 26 bales/h (average of 14 bales/h). Bale mass averaged 477 kg at 46% moisture content [260 kg dry mass (DM)/bale at a density of 166 kg DM/m³]. Diesel fuel consumption averaged 8.5 L/t DM. Harvesting cost with the biobaler was estimated at $33/t DM in high yield with rapid harvest (20 bale/h) and $64/t DM at low capacity (10 bales/h) which can be caused by lower yield or poor traction.

The Eastern Wild Turkey ( Meleagris gallopavo sylvestris) is a generalist forest species that experiences high mortality when snow reduces food availability. Although increasing amounts of cornfield habitat may benefit Wild Turkeys by providing an alternate food source, reduced forest cover or elevated levels of forest fragmentation associated with increased corn ( Zea mays) production could be detrimental. We evaluated the hypothesis that spring density of male Wild Turkeys increases with the amount of corn habitat as long as forest cover remains a dominant landscape component and that this increase is more prominent following a winter with thick snow accumulations. We performed point counts and corrected for imperfect detection in 2003 and 2004 at 130 randomly distributed sites in southern Quebec. After a mild winter, male density peaked in landscapes characterized by 25-50% forest cover and a large amount of edge between forest and open habitats. After a harsh winter, male density decreased with annual crop cover when forests represented 40%. Male aggregation was higher and increased with male density at a slower rate than if individuals had been randomly distributed, yet landscape structure had only a marginal effect on aggregation. Our results suggest that Wild Turkeys' response to landscape structure depends on environmental conditions and that this generalist forest species benefits from cornfields where forest cover is fragmented but abundant.

The forest of the island is typically boreal and, at the time of the introduction, was dominated by balsam fir (Abies balsamea), white spruce (Picea glauca), and black spruce (P. mariana). Since then, the vegetation has been modified as a result of high deer density (16 deer·km-2) and heavy browsing. The most important change is the progressive decline of balsam fir stands, formerly the prevalent forest type. We describe that process at three spatial and time scales. On the largest scale (whole island, 100 y), we examined the age and species composition of stands on recent forest maps as well as the age structure of 2,555 individual balsam fir and white spruce trees. Balsam fir was largely dominant before 1930, but was replaced by white spruce afterwards. We also estimated that fir stands, which now cover 20% of the island, occupied about 40% of the total area initially. On an intermediate scale (1,200 km2, 30 y), we examined the natural regeneration established after an insect outbreak that took place in 1971-1972 and massively killed predominantly balsam fir forests. In that area, white spruce regeneration now largely replaces that of balsam fir. On a finer scale (< 1 km2, 3 y), we monitored 1,800 balsam fir seedlings (2-5 cm high) individually tagged.

We hypothesized that habitat modifications through logging and forest fire alter the space-use pattern of woodland caribou and result ultimately in lowered density. To test this hypothesis, density, distribution, space-use patterns, and mortality of caribou in disturbed landscapes (DLs) and undisturbed landscapes (ULs) of central Québec were quantified by a systematic aerial survey (42 539 km2) and telemetry of 68 adult caribou females. A ground survey of terrestrial and arboreal lichens was carried out to estimate production of lichens in DLs and ULs. Three populations that occupied between 10 000 and 15 000 km2 were identified in the study area. Caribou abundance was not limited by intraspecific competition for food. Production of terrestrial lichens was estimated to support 3 to 4 times the surveyed caribou density (1.2–2.1–100 km−2). Pregnancy rate was almost 100%, indicating that females were not food-limited. Space-use patterns were affected by forest disturbance. In DLs, caribou increased home range sizes and reduced fidelity to seasonal and annual home ranges, probably to avoid disturbed habitats. In response, the probability of surviving decreased with the extent of DL within home ranges. To help keep direct and indirect sources of caribou mortality at very low levels, forest management strategies should be oriented toward the protection of large interconnected blocks of forest to favour caribou spacing away from humans and predators and to maintain adequate space-use strategies.",2007,10,semantic_scholar

The postglacial migration of jack pine is an example of low-density migration. The first individuals were probably restricted to dry sites such as eolian deposits and river terraces, upon which more frequent fires had a greater impact.",2011,10,semantic_scholar

Islands were significantly drier and warmer than the mainland, and maximum values of Fire Weather Index were significantly higher on the islands during both the early part of the fire season (May-June) and the whole fire season (May-September). The lightning density within the lake perimeter was significantly higher than in the surrounding mainland (0.63 v. 0.48year � 1 km � 2 respectively). This pattern was a result of the differences in lightning density during the first half of the lightning season.

Ash trees (Fraxinus spp.) can be abundant in these forests. However, invasion by the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) in North America threatens their survival. The disappearance of ash will have a large impact on the riparian forest composition in itself. It is not known what the consequences would be for the remaining forest if ash plays an important role in the beaver diet. Inventory plots across an ash gradient were measured in Plaisance National Park, Quebec, Canada, to collect data and to establish if (1) trees and saplings of this genus were selected or avoided by beavers, (2) if other genera had a lower or a greater probability of being consumed compared to ash, and (3) if ash density could affect the probability of consumption of other genera. Of all genera present in the park, ash trees were selected in the highest number of plots. Only two genera, Carpinus and Populus, had a higher probability of being consumed than ash. These genera are not abundant in the park, and neither in riparian forests of the temperate biome, and thus are not good candidates to replace ash as a staple for beavers. The most abundant genus in riparian temperate forests, along with ash, is Acer. In this study, Acer trees were not selected, and as for Acer saplings, were less likely to be consumed than ash. Mixed results were obtained about genera that could become more likely to be consumed as ash density decreases. It would seem that the disappearance of ash would not cause a switch to a single or a few genera in the future, which may be due to the high diversity of genera present in temperate riparian forests. However, ash may not disappear completely due to its capacity to sprout following the death of the aboveground portion of ash trees. This scenario is discussed in light of the susceptibility of intermediate-sized ash stems to be colonized by the emerald ash borer and of the greater likelihood of beavers to feed on these same-sized stems.",2022,10,semantic_scholar
