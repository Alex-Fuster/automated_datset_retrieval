<p style=""margin-bottom:11px;"">Sampling was conducted at the IISD Experimental Lakes Area (IISD-ELA), a remote research and monitoring facility in north-western Ontario, Canada. We sampled two lakes in summer and autumn of 2017 and repeated the summer and autumn sampling in five lakes in 2018. There are 14 species of fish across all the study lakes (mean 8, range 6-10 species per lake). All lakes have overlapping community compositions, including Salvelinus namaycush, a cold-water top predator, in every lake. Water samples were taken at six depths, dispersed vertically throughout the water column at the deepest centre point of each lake. The sampling points were distributed at six evenly spaced intervals, but because the lakes were different depths, absolute measurements differ between the lakes. We refer to the shallowest depth as sampling point one and the deepest depth as point six. Four 500 ml replicate water samples were taken per depth (for a total of 24 samples per lake per season) using an electrical pump and Jayflex PVC tubing (Winnipeg Johnston Plastics, MB, Canada) secured to a weight. In total, 336 samples were taken throughout the entire study (24 samples x 2 lake states x seven lake replicates). Water was filtered onto 47 mm 0.7 μm pore GF/F filters using an electric vacuum pump and filtering manifold (Pall Corporation, ON, Canada). The filters were immediately stored in screw-cap tubes at -20 ⁰C and then shipped on dry ice to McGill University, Montréal for molecular analysis. DNA was extracted from filters using the Qiagen Blood and Tissue kit. All samples were treated with the OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, California). DNA was amplified in triplicate 12.5 µl reactions using 12S MiFish-U primers selected to target fish assemblages tagged with Illumina adapters. PCR replicates from each sample were combined and cleaned with a 1 : 0.875 ratio of AMPure beads. Samples were dual-indexed with v2 Nextera DNA indexes (Illumina). The samples were cleaned again with AMPure beads, quantified and equimolarised to 3 ng/μl for sequencing. Sequencing was conducted using 2 x 250 bp Illumina MiSeq at Génome Québec, Montréal. We used custom scripts to remove adapters, merge paired sequences, check quality and generate amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs). Samples were received as demultiplexed fastq files from Génome Québec. Non-biological nucleotides were removed (primers, indices and adapters) using cutadapt. Paired reads were merged using PEAR. Quality scores for sequences were analysed with FASTQC. Amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs) were generated using the UNOISE3 package, which uses a denoising pipeline to remove sequencing error and to cluster sequences into single variants (100% similarity). The full pipeline is available from https://github.com/CristescuLab/YAAP. After ASVs were generated, we assigned taxonomy using BLAST+ and BASTA, a last common ancestor algorithm. We used a custom reference database which contained only fish known to exist in the Lake of the Woods region (Ontario, CA), downloaded from the NCBI database on 12 August 2018.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px;""><b>Acoustic telemetry</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px;"">Salvelinus namaycush were captured by angling and surgically implanted with coded, acoustic, pressure-sensing telemetry tags (model V13P-1L; Vemco, Innovasea, Bedford, NS). Between five and ten tagged adults were monitored in each lake during the study period. The pressure sensor on each tag was calibrated in the lake it was deployed in prior to implantation to ensure accurate depth readings (resolution: 0.08-0.15 m). The tags randomly emitted signals every 120-300 s (lakes 373, 626 and 239) or every 110-250 s (lakes 223 and 224). A number of data logging receivers (VR2W, 69 kHz; Vemco, Innovasea, Bedford, NS) were deployed under water at specific locations in the lake such that the ""listening radius"" of each receiver (spherical volume ~350 m diameter) overlapped slightly with the other receivers, resulting in maximum coverage of the lake. Each receiver was attached to a floating buoy and suspended ~2 m below the water's surface or ~2-4 m above the bottom of the lake (dependent on mooring apparatus design). The receivers logged acoustic signals emitted by the tags through an omnidirectional hydrophone. Data (fish ID, date, time, pressure sensor reading) were continuously collected except when receivers were removed from the lake and downloaded (~8 h duration per lake, semi-annually). The pressure sensor data were converted to depth information using Vemco VUE software for each detection for the duration of the study (yielding ~200-700 depth detections for each fish in a typical 24-hr period). After downloading, duplicate detections (single tag signals detected by more than one receiver) were removed. In order to assess whether different time periods of cumulative eDNA persistence in the lakes affected the relationship between eDNA counts and telemetry data, we grouped telemetry data for each fish at different temporal scales, ranging from the day of eDNA sample collection, as well as one week, and one month prior to sample collection. The total number of detections of all fish were grouped into depth intervals reflecting the vertical distribution of the eDNA sampling (6 intervals per lake). We adjusted for varying depth interval size and variation in the total amount of telemetry detections for each lake over the relevant time period.</p> <p>Significant advances have been made towards surveying animal and plant communities using DNA isolated from environmental samples. Despite rapid progress, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the ""ecology"" of environmental DNA (eDNA), particularly its temporal and spatial distribution and how this is shaped by abiotic and biotic processes. Here, we tested how seasonal variation in thermal stratification and animal habitat preferences influence the distribution of eDNA in lakes. We sampled eDNA depth profiles of five dimictic lakes during both summer stratification and autumn turnover, each containing warm- and cool-water fishes as well as the cold-water stenotherm, lake trout (<i>Salvelinus namaycush</i>). Habitat use by <i>S. namaycush</i> was validated by acoustic telemetry and was significantly related to eDNA distribution during stratification. Fish eDNA became ""stratified"" into layers during summer months, reflecting lake stratification and the thermal niches of the species. During summer months, <i>S. namaycush</i>, which rarely ventured into shallow waters, could only be detected at the deepest layers of the lakes, whereas the eDNA of warm-water fishes was much more abundant above the thermocline. By contrast, during autumn lake turnover, the fish species assemblage as detected by eDNA was homogenous throughout the water column. These findings contribute to our overall understanding of the ""ecology"" of eDNA within lake ecosystems, illustrating how the strong interaction between seasonal thermal structure in lakes and thermal niches of species on very localised spatial scales influences our ability to detect species.</p> <p>All instructions for use are found in the README file.</p>

<p>Alfaro-Sánchez R, Johnstone JF, Cumming SG, Day N, Mack MC, Walker XJ and Baltzer JL (2022) What Drives Reproductive Maturity and Efficiency in Serotinous Boreal Conifers? Front. Ecol. Evol. 10:869130. doi: 10.3389/fevo.2022.869130</p> <p>In boreal North America, much of the landscape is covered by fire-adapted forests dominated by serotinous conifers. For these forests, reductions in fire return interval could limit reproductive success, owing to insufficient time for stands to reach reproductive maturity i.e., to initiate cone production. Improved understanding of the drivers of reproductive maturity can provide important information about the capacity of these forests to self-replace following fire. Here, we assessed the drivers of reproductive maturity in two dominant and widespread conifers, semi-serotinous black spruce and serotinous jack pine. Presence or absence of female cones were recorded in approximately 15,000 individuals within old and recently burned stands in two distinct ecozones of the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. Our results show that reproductive maturity was triggered by a minimum tree size threshold rather than an age threshold, with trees reaching reproductive maturity at smaller sizes where environmental conditions were more stressful. The number of reproductive trees per plot increased with stem density, basal area, and at higher latitudes (colder locations). The harsh climatic conditions present at these higher latitudes, however, limited the recruitment of jack pine at the treeline ecotone. The number of reproductive black spruce trees increased with deeper soils, whereas the number of reproductive jack pine trees increased where soils were shallower. We examined the reproductive efficiency i.e., the number of seedlings recruited per reproductive tree, linking pre-fire reproductive maturity of recently burned stands and post-fire seedling recruitment (recorded up to 4 years after the fires) and found that a reproductive jack pine can recruit on average three times more seedlings than a reproductive black spruce. We suggest that the higher reproductive efficiency of jack pine can explain the greater resilience of this species to wildfire compared with black spruce. Overall, these results help link life history characteristics such as reproductive maturity to variation in post-fire recruitment of dominant serotinous conifers.</p> <p>This dataset can be open in excel. </p><p>Funding provided by: Government of the Northwest Territories*<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: Project 170</p><p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: </p><p>Funding provided by: National Science Foundation<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001<br>Award Number: 1542150</p><p>Funding provided by: NASA Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment*<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: NNX15AT71A</p><p>Funding provided by: Royal Society of New Zealand<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001509<br>Award Number: </p><p>Funding provided by: Northern Science Training Program*<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: </p> black spruce; jack pine; serotiny; boreal forest; post-fire regeneration; Reproductive size threshold; Reproductive age threshold","2022-07-07","3,10","location","no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/156; https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.76hdr7sth","no","zenodo"

We ran linear trapping transects composed of Longworth traps placed every 40 m and alternately placed along parallel adjacent transects. We trapped daily during the activity period of chipmunks from early May until early September every year. At each capture, we recorded identity, sex, body mass, and age.</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><strong>Exploration test</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;"">We quantified among-individual differences in exploration using a novel environment test in an open-field arena on 396 individuals from 2012 to 2017. The experimental arena consists of an empty white box (80 × 80 × 40 cm), with no refuge, and a grid marked on the bottom. This arena was placed at the center of the trapping grid. Before the test, we placed the captured individual for one minute in an opaque tubular entrance for acclimation. Exploration in the novel environment was video recorded for 90 s. Using The Observer XT11 software (<em>Noldus</em>), an exploration score was calculated for each test by counting the number of lines crossed by an individual during 90 s (Réale et al. 2007). We ran two tests per individual at 1-year intervals (generally during the first and the second year of life) to obtain a phenotypic value representative of the individual's life. We then obtained the exploration profile of each individual by calculating best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) for exploration using an LMM controlling for date, hour of the test, waiting time before the test, site, and number of trials, all specified as fixed effects, and year, chipmunk and experimenter IDs as random effects. We used a method proposed by Dingemanse et al. (2020) to account for the variance around the BLUPs in the statistical analyses.</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><strong>Hair samples and stable isotope analysis </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;"">We collected hair samples from 107 adult individuals over four successive years from 2013 to 2016. Each hair-sampled individual had been tested for exploration during the study period. We cut the recent darker hair before and after molting in late June, close to the skin, at the same place on the right thigh. Samples of the main food items available (except fungi and insects) were collected between June and October 2013 and dried until constant weight before measuring isotope values (<em>δ</em><sup>15</sup>N/<em>δ</em><sup>13</sup>C).</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;"">The protocol for isotopic analysis followed Dammhahn and Goodman (2014). Isotope data are presented in ‰ <em>δ</em><sup>15</sup>N relative to nitrogen in air or <em>δ</em><sup>13</sup>C relative to Pee Dee Belemnite calculated as follows: <em>δ</em>X = [(Rsample<em>/</em>Rstandard) − 1] × 103, where <em>δ</em>X is either <em>δ</em><sup>15</sup>N or <em>δ</em><sup>13</sup>C, and R is the respective <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N or <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratio. For quantification of <em>δ</em><sup>15</sup>N and <em>δ</em><sup>13</sup>C, approximately 1 g of total dry hair was enclosed into tin capsules and processed through an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. We carried out mass spectrometry analyses on the 2013-14 hair and food source samples at the Center for Stable Isotope Research &amp; Analysis (KOSI) in Göttingen (Germany) using an isotope ratio mass spectrophotometer (Delta Plus, Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany). We carried out the analyses on the 2015-16 samples at the GEOTOP laboratories of the Université du Québec à Montréal (Montréal, Canada), using an isotope ratio mass spectrophotometer (Isoprime 100, Elementar, Vario MicroCube). Internal reference materials are normalized on NBS 19-LSVEC for <em>δ</em><sup>13</sup>C and on IAEA-N1, N-2 and N-3 for <em>δ</em><sup>15</sup>N. To obtain non-biased niche width metrics (i.e., ellipse area, see below), we corrected the raw data for laboratory effects. We used two conservative linear models with the laboratory and year of analysis as fixed effects<em> </em>on <em>δ</em><sup>15</sup>N and <em>δ</em><sup>13</sup>C values as response variables. On GEOTOP data, we subtracted 0.57‰ in <em>δ</em><sup>15</sup>N and added 0.38‰ in <em>δ</em><sup>13</sup>C (i.e., estimates of laboratory effect).</p>
<p><strong>Red maple and American beech masting </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Chipmunks feed mostly on seeds from the dominant American beech and red maple and also the less common sugar maple (<em>Acer saccharum</em>) These tree species produce seeds in mast events every 2–3 years in southern Québec. To quantify temporal variation in the availability of key food sources for chipmunks, we estimated red maple and American beech seed productions. We used 26 plastic buckets (with 0.06 m² opening) installed on two metallic poles at 50 cm above the ground and 1 m away from the trunk of a tree. On each site, we chose 8 to 13 mature red maple and 13 mature American beech trees uniformly distributed on the trapping grid and with a minimum circumference at breast height of 31 cm. We collected bucket contents twice yearly, in July and October. For each tree species, we calculated the average number of seeds collected per m². We use the term mast year for 2013 and 2015 and<em> </em>non-mast year for 2014 and 2016 to indicate temporal variability in food availability.</p> <p>Individual diet specialization (IDS) is widespread and can affect the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations in significant ways. Extrinsic factors (e.g., food abundance) and individual variation in energetic needs, morphology, or physiology, have been suggested as drivers of IDS. Behavioral traits like exploration and boldness can also impact foraging decisions, although their effects on IDS have not yet been investigated. Specifically, variation among individuals in exploratory behavior and their position along <span>the exploration/exploitation trade-off </span>may <span>affect their foraging behavior, acquisition of food items and home-range size, which may in turn influence</span> the diversity of their diet. Here we analyzed stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in hair of wild eastern chipmunks, <em>Tamias striatus,</em> to investigate the influence of individual differences in exploration on IDS. We found that exploration profile, sex, and yearly fluctuations in food availability explained differences in the degree of dietary specialization and in plasticity in stable carbon and stable nitrogen over time. Thus, consistent individual differences in exploration can be an important driver of within-population niche specialization and could therefore affect within-species competition. Our results highlight the need for a more thorough investigation of the mechanisms underlying the link between individual behavioral differences and diet specialization in wild animal populations.</p> <p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: </p><p>Funding provided by: The Fonds de Recherche du Québec – Nature et technologies*<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: </p><p>Funding provided by: German Research Foundation<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659<br>Award Number: </p> C and N stable isotopes; exploration behavior; diet specialization; Pulsed resources","2022-03-08","3,7,4,6",NA,"yes","L","repository",".csv","administrative unit","Administrative unit","NA","Tamias striatus","2012-2017","2012","2017","source link abstract, dataset","5","not given","0.2","not given","presence only","NA","NA","The American Naturalist","https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5898699","yes",NA

The wood turtle (Glyptemys insculpta) is a terrestrial freshwater species listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Considering its conservation status and the paucity of information currently available on parentage relationship for the species, we performed a microsatellite analysis to study the mating system of wood turtles in the Shawinigan River (Québec). We sampled 38 clutches over two years (14 in 2006 and 24 in 2007), for a total of 248 offspring genotyped with seven microsatellite loci. The reconstructed genotypes of the fathers revealed that reproductive success in the sampled clutches varied greatly between males and are positively correlated with the number of mates and clutches sired. Frequency of multiple paternity was estimated at 37% through a consensus of three different estimation methods. Positive correlation was observed between the genetic diversity of clutches and the number of fathers. Repeat paternity, however, was observed in 88% of the clutches by the same female in successive years, which suggests either a frequent use of sperm storage, or re-mating with the same partner in successive years. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Data_PaternityAnalysis<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Microsatellite data for all the offspring and adults wood turtle used in the analysis.

Moreover, the role it plays in the trait – demography relationship remains unclear.
Here, we hypothesize that shade tolerance can be achieved by alternative combinations of traits depending on the species' functional group (evergreen vs. deciduous species), and that its ability to explain the array of traits involved in demography will also vary between these two groups.
We used dimension reduction to identify the main trait spectra for 48 tree species, including 23 evergreens and 25 deciduous – dispersed across 21 genera and 13 families. We assessed the relationship between functional traits, shade tolerance and demographic performance at high and low light using structural equation modelling.
The dimensions found corresponded to the trait spectra previously observed in the literature and were significantly related to measures of demography. However, our results support the existence of a divergence between evergreen and deciduous species in the way shade tolerance relates to the demography of species along light gradients.
We show that shade tolerance can be attained through different combination of traits depending on the functional and geographical context, and thus its utilization as a predictor of forest dynamics and species coexistence requires previous knowledge on the role it plays in the demographic performance of the species under study. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Demography_LifeHistories<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Life histories values for each species and site, as obtained from the parameterization carried out in studies that used the model SORTIE.

<p>The source plant community was isolated from a eutrophic pond adjacent to fallowed agricultural fields on the Macdonald campus of McGill University, Quebec, Canada (45° 42' N, 73° 94' W). The pond sustains a diverse community of floating macrophytes, the four most abundant being <em>Lemna</em> <em>minor</em> (Lm), <em>Lemna</em> <em>trisulca</em> (Lt), <em>Spirodela</em> <em>polyrhiza</em> (Sp) and <em>Wolffia</em> <em>columbiana</em> (Wc), all in the family Lemnaceae. Large samples consisting of hundreds of thousands of individuals were taken in June 2020 and manually separated into the constituent species.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Experimental design</span></p>
<p>The experiment was conducted at the LEAP (Large Experimental Array of Ponds) facility at  Gault Nature Reserve of McGill University in Quebec, Canada (45° 32' N, 73° 08' W), (Fugère et al. 2020) (Fig. 1). 48 large mesocosms (surface area=2.43m<sup>2</sup>) were filled each with 500L of water piped from Lac Hertel, a mesotrophic lake on the reserve, 1km upstream of the experiment. The water was sieved to remove fish, tadpoles, macroinvertebrates, and macrophytes, but contained intact communities of zooplankton and phytoplankton. The removal of these larger organisms was to decrease unwanted variation due to sampling. Material from the source community was used to assemble <span lang=""EN-US"">four community types defined by the initial relative abundance of each species (10%, 20%, 30% or 40%) (Table 1)</span>. <span lang=""EN-US"">Relative abundance was calculated as mass-weighted frequencies using an average value of individual mass for each species. Each community was seeded with a total of 1g wet mass of community biomass, which works out to between ~2,000–3,000 individuals, depending on the community type (Table 1). Abundances of the larger species were determined by manual counting, while Wc, only ~0.5mm wide, was weighed and added in bulk, using an estimate of mean frond mass. Initial community densities translated to roughly 5–10% surface cover.  Communities were mixed after inoculation to remove any initial spatial variation.  Each of the four community types was replicated in 12 mesocosms (total number of mesocosms = 48) which were arranged in six blocks of eight mesocosms, each block containing two replicates of each community type, with community type randomized within block. </span>All mesocosms received a one-time initial addition of inorganic Nitrogen and Phosphorus (KNO<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>KPO<sub>4</sub>), to obtain initial dissolved concentrations of these nutrients in the mesocosms comparable to those of the pond from which the source community was taken (800 µgL-1 N and 40 µgL-1 P).  The mesocosms were covered with 70% shade cloth to mimic canopy cover. Although this minimized the input of wind-carried debris like leaf litter, rainwater could pass through the mesh cloth, which roughly balanced water lost due to evaporation. Communities were then left to grow for 12 weeks, from the beginning of July to the end of September, ending shortly before the first frost. <span lang=""EN-US"">All mesocosms were randomly sampled every two weeks to estimate species relative abundances. This was done by first mixing the communities to break up species clustering </span><span lang=""EN-US"">(Hart et al. 2019, Jewell and Bell 2022)</span><span lang=""EN-US"">, then removing a fixed percentage of the surface area (~5%) with a net. Although mixing eliminated communities' spatial structure, it allowed us to efficiently obtain representative samples. These samples were exhaustively counted before being returned to the mesocosm.</span></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Statistical analysis</span></p>
<p>The main goal of this experiment was to estimate the contributions of species sorting, ecological drift, and initial state to community change. Overall variation in final species composition among communities can be broken into these three components, whose contributions to variation can be partitioned using an Anova framework (Travisano et al. 1995, Bell 2013). If Y<sub>ij</sub> is the final frequency of the focal species in community type i and replicate j, then its deviation from that species' mean initial frequency, Y<sub>initial</sub>, can be partitioned into three additive components representing the three sources of variation:</p>
<p align=""center"">Y<sub>ij</sub>  - Y<sub>initial</sub> = (Y<sub>ij</sub> - Y<sub>i</sub>) + (Y<sub>i</sub> - Y) + (Y - Y<sub>initial</sub>)  </p>
<p>where Y<sub>i</sub> is the mean final frequency of the focal species in community type i, and Y is the grand mean final frequency of the focal species across all community types and replicates. For n community types (communities with different initial species composition) each replicated m times, the total variation attributable to sorting, drift and initial state can be calculated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>nm S (Y - Y<sub>initial</sub>)<sup>2</sup>, the shift in grand mean representing an overall convergence to an equilibrium composition (sorting),</li>
<li>m S (Y<sub>i</sub> - Y)<sup>2</sup>, the variance among community types around the grand mean representing the influence of a community's initial state, and</li>
<li>S S (Y<sub>ij</sub> - Y<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2</sup>, the variance among replicates of same community type representing neutral variation (drift).</li>
</ul>
<p>Such a partition was done for each species at the end of the experiment to estimate the overall contributions of sorting, drift and initial state, as well as for each intermediate census to assess how the contributions changed over time.</p>
<p>We calculated a normalized value of the change in relative abundance of each species at each census in each mesocosm as the difference between the relative abundance of that species in the current and immediately preceding census, divided by its relative abundance in the preceding census. For each species, we used the regression of this normalized change in relative abundance on its preceding relative abundance to determine whether species dynamics were frequency-dependent. We used the X-intercept (at which change in relative abundance is zero) as an estimate of the equilibrium abundance of that species in a stable community.</p> <p>Community dynamics are governed by two opposed processes: species sorting, which produces deterministic dynamics leading to an equilibrium state, and ecological drift, which produces stochastic dynamics. Despite a great deal of theoretical and empirical work aiming to demonstrate the predominance of one or the other of these processes, the importance of drift in structuring communities and maintaining species diversity remains contested. Here we present the results of a basic community dynamics experiment using floating aquatic plants, designed to measure the relative contributions of species sorting and ecological drift to community change over about a dozen generations. We found that species sorting became overwhelmingly dominant as the experiment progressed, and directed communities towards a stable equilibrium state maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection. The dynamics of any particular species depended on how far its initial frequency was from its equilibrium frequency, however, and consequently the balance of sorting and drift varied among species.</p> <p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: CGSD2 ‐ 534217 ‐ 2019</p><p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: RGPIN‐2018‐03846</p>","2022-12-26","3,4,8,10","non-field experiment","no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"zenodo"

A typical habitat isodar is a regression curve plotting competitor densities in two adjacent habitats when individual fitness is equal. Despite the increasing use of habitat isodars, their application remains largely limited to areas composed of pairs of adjacent habitats that are defined a priori. We developed a resampling method that uses data from wildlife surveys to build isodars in heterogeneous landscapes without having to predefine habitat types. The method consists in randomly placing blocks over the survey area and dividing those blocks in two adjacent sub-blocks of the same size. Animal abundance is then estimated within the two sub-blocks. This process is done 100 times. Different functional forms of isodars can be investigated by relating animal abundance and differences in habitat features between sub-blocks. We applied this method to abundance data of raccoons and striped skunks, two of the main hosts of rabies virus in North America. Habitat selection by raccoons and striped skunks depended on both conspecific abundance and the difference in landscape composition and structure between sub-blocks. When conspecific abundance was low, raccoons and striped skunks favored areas with relatively high proportions of forests and anthropogenic features, respectively. Under high conspecific abundance, however, both species preferred areas with rather large corn-forest edge densities and corn field proportions. Based on random sampling techniques, we provide a robust method that is applicable to a broad range of species, including medium- to large-sized mammals with high mobility. The method is sufficiently flexible to incorporate multiple environmental covariates that can reflect key requirements of the focal species. We thus illustrate how isodar theory can be used with wildlife surveys to assess density-dependent habitat selection over large geographic extents. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Capture data of raccoons and striped skunks in Montérégie and Estrie regions<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Capture data of raccoons and striped skunks during wildlife surveys in Montérégie and Estrie regions, Québec, Canada.

<p>We deployed each camera as accurately as possible to the random locations. We mounted cameras at level, 75 cm from the ground on trees with a diameter at breast height of 8 to 10 cm and facing the North quadrant. We removed vegetation obstructing the camera's lens. Cameras recorded pictures for 14 days in each exclosure, taking a systematic picture every 5 minutes for a total of 288 pictures per day. </p>
<p>To classify automatically the presence and absence of white-tailed deer, we analyzed 485,338 pictures collected during 2,100 camera trap days using an artificial intelligence from Tan and Le (2019). We classified the pictures with the neural network/architecture EfficientNet from the EfficientNet-Pytorch library (Melas-Kyriazi 2020). We used a sample of 2968 pictures pre-classified as deer presence (n=1484) and absence (n=1484) to train the model and 636 pictures to validate the model efficiency. The model classified the pictures with a degree of precision of 94%. </p>
<p>To estimate visibility and model the detection probability of each camera, we used a profile board composed of four panels of 50 x 25 cm to estimate the lateral cover in front of the camera. We took a measure at 5 and 10 meters in front of each camera, and then estimated the percentage of visibility at each site, following the approach in Ferron et al. (1996). The approach consist of averaging the grade of lateral cover of four squares on a blanket held vertically in front of the evaluator (1: 0-19% of visibility, 2: 20-39%, 3: 40-59%, 4: 60-79%, 5: 80-100%), then multiplying it by 20 and deducing 10, for example: ((1 + 3 + 4 + 4) / 4) * 20 – 10 = 50 % of lateral cover visibility at 5 m in front of the camera. The same approach was used at 10 m. We also recorded whether the camera was pointing at a deer trail or not.</p>
<p>At each camera trap site, we surveyed all saplings and merchant trees present per species in a circular area of 100 m2 (5.64 m radius) centered on the camera. We tallied saplings per species and diameter at breast height (DBH, 1.3 m) classes to compute basal area per species.</p>
<p>We measured vegetation of the ground layer in a 4 m2 circular plot located at 2 m in front of each camera. We estimated the percentage of cover of common herbaceous plants regularly browsed by deer on the island: Cornus canadensis, Maianthemum canadense, Chamaenerion angustifolium, Clintonia borealis, Rubus sp., and Poaceae sp. We kept only two species for the analysis (i.e., C. canadensis and Rubus spp.) because the global presence of the other species at all camera trap sites was less than 4%, and therefore their availability was not high enough to include these species in the analysis.</p>
<p>To define spatial configuration, we used ArcMap tools (ArcGIS v10.4; Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redland, CA, USA), to measure the distance of the closest forest cover and the shortest distance to the exclosure border (m) for each camera trap site. When the camera was located under forest cover, we set the distance at 0.</p>
<p>To obtain convergence, we scaled all the covariates (MacKenzie et al. 2018). Pairwise correlations between all variables were all below 0.48. </p> <p>The exclusion of herbivores in forest areas is a strategy used to reduce the impact of selective browsing and increase the regeneration of desired plant species. On Anticosti Island (Québec, Canada), selective browsing by white-tailed deer prevents the regeneration of balsam fir – white birch forests leading to their conversion into white spruce forests. Large deer exclosures were established for ca . 10 to 12 years in clear-cuts with patches of residual forest from 2001 to 2006 to assist in the natural regeneration of fir stands and to provide shelter and food resources for deer. Our objective was to assess how deer use exclosures after the removal of fences according to their spatial configuration and habitat composition. We randomly distributed automatic cameras for periods of 14 days during summer in six exclosures ranging from 3.1 to 11.2 km2 (n=25 cameras per exclosure) from which deer were reduced for 10 to 12 years. We compared candidate occupancy models that included spatial configuration and food resource variables while simultaneously controlling for variables affecting detection probability. We obtained weak evidence that deer habitat use increased by 19% when forage resources, represented by the cover of <em>Cornus canadensis</em>, increased from 0 to 100%. None of the other variables (distance between the border of exclosures and cameras and distance between forest patches and cameras) was retained, suggesting that the use of regenerating forests by deer in summer after a period of exclusion is related to forage availability and therefore, any forest management that improves food production during summer should help maintain or increase habitat use by deer.</p> <p>Data files require Excel to be open</p><p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: RDCPJ525308-18</p>","2022-09-01","3,7",NA,"yes","L","repository",".xlsx","site IDs","not given","Map, administrative unit","white-tailed deer","2020","2020","2020","source link abstract",">1","not given","not given","not given","presence-absence","NA","NA","Wildlife Biology","NA","no","zenodo"

Anthropogenic disturbances have been demonstrated to affect animal behavior, distribution, and abundance, but assessment of their impacts on fitness-related traits has received little attention. We hypothesized that human activities and infrastructure cause a decrease in the individual performance of preys because of anthropogenically enhanced predation risk. We evaluated the impacts of commercial logging and road networks on the fitness of a large herbivore known to be sensitive to human disturbance: the forest-dwelling woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). For 8 consecutive years (2004–2011) we monitored 59 individuals using GPS telemetry in the Charlevoix region of Québec, Canada. We also used Very High Frequency telemetry locations collected on 28 individuals from 1999–2000. We related habitat selection of adult caribou at various spatio-temporal scales to their probability of dying from predation, and to indices of their reproductive success and energy expenditure. The probability that adult caribou died from predation increased with the proportion of recent disturbances (including cutblocks ≤5 years old) in their annual home range. The respective effects of increasing paved and forestry road densities depended upon the overall road density within the home range of caribou. At a finer scale of 10 to 15 days before their death, caribou that were killed by a predator selected for recent disturbances more than individuals that survived, and avoided old mature conifer stands. The home range area of caribou increased with road density. Finally, the composition of the home range of females had no effect on their reproductive success. We show that human activities and infrastructure may influence the individual performance of large prey species in highly managed regions. We outline the need to consider the full set of impacts that human development may have on threatened animal populations, with particular emphasis on predator-prey relationships and population dynamics. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Data on the annual home range of Charlevoix caribou<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Description of the home range data collected using VHF telemetry from 1999-2000, and GPS telemetry from 2004-2011, on 87 forest-dwelling caribou in the Charlevoix region of Québec, Canada.

Habitat selection has received considerable attention from ecologists during the last decades, yet the underlying forces shaping individual differences in habitat selection are poorly documented. Some of these differences could be explained by the early experience of individuals in their natal habitat. By selecting habitat attributes like those encountered early in life, individuals could improve resource acquisition, survival, and ultimately fitness. This behaviour, known as natal habitat preference induction (NHPI), could be particularly common in large mammals, because offspring generally stay with their mother for an extended period. We used three complementary approaches to assess NHPI in a marked population of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou): 1) population-based resource selection functions (RSFs), 2) individual-based RSFs, and 3) behavioural repeatability analyses. All approaches compared the behaviour of calves in their natal range to their behaviour as independent subadults during the snow-covered (Dec – Apr) and snow-free (May – Nov) seasons. Using RSFs, we found that the magnitude of habitat selection between calf and subadult stages differed for most covariates, yet the signs of statistically significant effects (selection vs. avoidance) were generally the same. We also found that some habitat selection tactics were highly repeatable across life stages. Notably, caribou responses to habitat disturbances were highly repeatable year-round, meaning that different individuals reacted differently, but consistently, to disturbances. This study highlights the potential role of natal habitat preference induction in shaping individual differences in habitat selection in large mammals and provides valuable knowledge for the management and conservation of a threatened species. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Repeatability data<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data used to estimate repeatability of habitat selection in a boreal population of woodland caribou in Charlevoix, Québec, Canada, 2004‒2011, during the snow-covered and snow-free seasons.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">RepeatabilityData.xlsx<br></div></div> Rangifer tarandus; Natal experience; behavioral repeatability Canada; Québec","2018-12-13","3,6",NA,"yes","M","repository",".xlsx","not given","Administrative unit","Map, administrative unit","Rangifer tarandus caribou","2004-2011","2004","2011","source publication text","7","not given","7250","source publication text","other","NA","NA","Ecology and Evolution","https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.4685","no",NA

In total, 24 predominantly perennial plant communities based on their economic spectrum (fast- versus slow-growing species) and differences in forb:grass ratio were chosen. Fast- or slow-growing grasses or forbs were selected from a pool of 24 grassland species that all co-occur locally at this site. Plants were assigned to fast- versus slow-growing species based on known growth rates (Fitter and Peat 1994, Fry et al. 2014) or after consultation with botanists (Jasper van Ruijven, Henrik Poorter, personal communication). Three fast- (Fast 1, Fast 2, Fast 3) and three slow- (Slow 1, Slow 2, Slow 3) growing plant communities were used in the experiment, each mixture consisted of 3 or 6 plant species (three grasses and/or three forbs) (Table 1). Specifically, sown plant communities differed in forb:grass ratios as per seeding such as a) three fast- or slow-growing forb species (100%); b) three fast- or slow-growing grass species (100%); or c) three fast- or slow-growing forbs and three fast- or slow-growing grasses (25% grass and 75% forb or 75% forb and 25% grass). Sowing density amounted to 12,000 seeds per subplot, representing each plant species in equal amounts of seeds. Seeds were obtained from specialized suppliers that provide seeds collected from wild plants (Cruydt Hoeck, Nijeberkoop, The Netherlands and MediGran, Hoorn, The Netherlands) in 2015. Additionally, after top-soil removal, in each block two experimental subplots were kept bare one from May 2015 onwards, and one from May 2016. These plots served as a control to permit the comparison of ecosystem processes in the absence of vegetation. In 2015 and 2016, during the growth season (May through September) all sown subplots and bare control subplots were regularly weeded to maintain the sown plant community composition. In total, this resulted in 2 temporal treatments (two- and one-year; represented by the level of subplots) and 25 plant community treatment combinations (2 community growth rates (fast, slow) ´ 4 forb:grass ratios (0:100; 25:75; 75:25 or 100:0 % forb:grass; represented by the level of plots) ´ 3 species combinations + 1 bare control), which were replicated across four blocks (200 subplots). The efficiency of the establishment of experimental plant communities was reported previously in De Long et al. (2019). Here, it was shown that the six different plant communities (Fast 1, Fast 2, Fast 3, Slow 1, Slow 2, Slow 3) significantly differed in their composition whereas fast-growing plant communities and slow-growing plant communities were clustering separately. Furthermore, it was reported that the actual percentage cover of both forbs and grasses corresponded well to the treatments.</p>

<h3>Data collection</h3>

<p><i>Above- and belowground biomass </i>- In the beginning of June 2017, aboveground biomass production was assessed within two randomly selected squares (25 x 25 cm; minimum 10 cm distant to the edge) in each subplot by cutting plants just above the soil level. Aboveground biomass of all samples was determined by weighing after drying at 70°C for 72 h and later converted to g per m². After the aboveground biomass was clipped in a subplot, one soil core (diameter 3 cm, 10 cm deep) was taken from the center of the square. The fresh soil weight was determined, and the roots were then washed over a 0.425 mm sieve. Root biomass was then determined after drying at 40 °C for 72 h and later converted to gram per gram fresh weight of soil.</p>

<p><i>Soil sampling </i>- Soil sampling was carried out in two sampling campaigns. First, soil samples were collected in March 2017. Here, 20 soil samples (metal corer: diameter 1 cm, 10 cm deep) were taken randomly per subplot, pooled and homogenized. Approximately 2 g of fresh soil was immediately frozen at -80 °C for DNA-based determination of the soil microbial community composition. In mid May 2017, an additional 20 soil samples (metal corer: diameter 3 cm, 10 cm deep) were taken randomly per subplot. The soil samples were pooled, homogenized and divided into several subsamples. About 50 g of fresh soil for nematode extraction was kept in a fridge (4 °C). Approximately 20 g was sieved (2 mm mesh size) to remove stones, roots, and invertebrates &gt;2 mm, and then stored at -20 °C for measurements of soil microbial properties (soil microbial respiration and biomass), the remaining soil was dried at 40 °C and used to measure soil abiotic characteristics.</p>

<p><i>Soil abiotic characteristics</i> - The soil was dried at 40 °C until the soil weight was stable and sieved (mesh size: 1.4 mm) to remove roots and stones. Three grams of dried soil were mixed with 30 ml of 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> and shaken for 2 h on a mechanical shaker with linear movement at 250 rpm. Samples were then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 3000 rpm. Then, 15 mL of the supernatant was filtered through a Whatman Puradisc Aqua 30 syringe filter with a cellulose acetate membrane and 130 μL HNO<sub>3</sub> was added to 12.87 mL of the filtrate. Soil extractable elements (Fe, K, Mg, P, S, Zn) were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Thermo Scientific iCAP 6500 Duo Instrument with axial and radial view and CID detector microwave digestion system). The remaining filtrate (2.13 mL) was used to measure soil pH and to measure nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub>-N) + nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub>-N) and ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub>-N) on a QuAAtro Autoanalyzer (Seal analytical).</p>

<p><i>Soil organic matter</i> - Soil organic matter content was estimated by the loss‐on‐ignition (LOI) method (Heiri et al. 2001). Approximately 5 g of soil was oven dried at 105 °C for 16 h and weighed. The sample was then burned at 550 °C for 5 h and weighed again. Soil organic matter was calculated as the percentage weight loss between the oven-dried and burned samples.</p>

<p><i>Soil microbial respiration and biomass</i> - Approximately 5 g soil (fresh weight) was weighed into 50 mL centrifuge tubes to determine soil microbial respiration and soil microbial biomass. The lid of each tube was sealed gas-tight using an O-ring and a rubber septum in the middle. For basal respiration measurements, the tubes were capped and flushed with CO<sub>2</sub>-free air to remove any CO<sub>2</sub> from the headspace. After 24 h hours of incubation at 20 °C, 12 ml of headspace was sampled using a gas-tight syringe. Microbial biomass was determined after addition of D-glucose-monohydrate using the substrate-induced respiration method (SIR) (Anderson and Domsch, 1978). Next, 2 ml of 75 mM D-glucose solution were added to each soil sample and placed on a horizontal shaker for 1 h. Tubes were capped, flushed with CO<sub>2</sub>-free air and incubated for 4 h at 20 °C. Again, 12 ml of headspace was sampled. Measurements of the CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were carried out on a Trace CG Ultra gas chromatograph (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy). Gravimetric soil water content was determined by drying the soil samples overnight at 60 °C to constant weight and calculating the difference in weight between fresh and dried soil.</p>

<p><i>Soil microbial community composition</i> - DNA was extracted from 0.75 g of soil using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. The DNA quantity was measured using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Hudson, NH, USA). Approximately 100 ng of DNA was used for a PCR. We used the primers ITS4ngs and ITS3mix targeting the ITS2 region of fungal genes (Tedersoo et al. 2015) and the primers 515FB and 806RB (Caporaso et al. 2012, Apprill et al. 2015, Parada et al. 2016) targeting the V4 region of the 16Sr RNA gene in bacteria. Presence of PCR product was checked using agarose gel electrophoresis. The PCR products were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter). Adapters and barcodes were added to samples using Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit set A (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The final PCR product was purified again with AMPure beads, checked using agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer before equimolar pooling. We pooled all fungal samples (200) in one Miseq PE250 run and divided the bacterial samples in two separate runs (100 samples each; 1<sup>st</sup> run: block 1 and 2, 2<sup>nd</sup> run: block 3 and 4). Libraries were sequenced at McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Center, Canada. Extraction negatives were also sequenced. A mock community, containing 10 fungal species, was included to investigate the accuracy of the bioinformatics analysis.</p>

<p>Bacterial sequences and fungal sequences were analyzed using the PIPITS pipeline and the Hydra pipeline, respectively (Gweon et al. 2015, Hollander 2017). In short, fungal sequences were paired using VSEARCH and quality was filtered using standard parameters. The ITS2 region was extracted using ITSx (Bengtsson-Palme et al. 2013). Short reads were removed, and sequences were clustered based on a 97% similarity threshold using VSEARCH and chimeric sequences were removed by comparing with UNITE uchime database. The representative sequences were identified using the RDP classifier against the UNITE database (Kõljalg et al. 2005). For bacterial sequences VSEARCH was used to pair sequences and cluster them or classification, SINA classification was used with the SILVA database.</p>

<p><i>Nematode extraction</i> - Decantation (Cobb 1918) and centrifugal flotation methods (Van Bezooijen 2006) were used to extract nematodes from 50 g fresh soil collected from block 1 and 2 (100 subplots). Briefly, soil samples were weighed, suspended in 3 L water and stirred until a homogenous suspension was obtained. The suspension was settled for 15 sec and the supernatant decanted into a plastic bowl. This procedure was repeated three times and the obtained suspension was passed through one 75 µm and three 45 µm sieves and collected into a 50 ml centrifuge tube. The nematode suspension was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 3000 rpm and the supernatant was carefully poured off. Sugar solution (484 g/L) was added, fully mixed with the remaining sediment in the tube and centrifuged again for 5 min at 1000 rpm. The supernatant was poured over a 30 µm sieve. Nematodes on the sieve were carefully rinsed with water and collected in a beaker for microscopic analysis). All nematodes were counted and classified by microscopy to one of five feeding types (root feeders, fungivores, omnivores, bacterivores, or predators) according to Yeates et al. (1993). However, predatory nematodes were excluded from further analysis because of low abundance.</p>

<h3>Data analysis</h3>

<p>We used linear mixed-effects models to test the effects of duration of plant growth (one- and two-year subplots), community growth rates (fast vs. slow), and forb:grass ratios on above- and root biomass, soil abiotic characteristics (pH, Fe, K, Mg, P, S, Zn, NO<sub>2</sub>-N +NO<sub>3</sub>-N, NH<sub>4</sub>-N), soil organic matter, soil microbial properties, and feeding types of nematodes. Thereby, plot and plant community identity (Fast 1, Fast 2, Fast 3, Slow 1, Slow 2, Slow 3) were included as random factors. Above- and belowground biomass, chemical abiotic characteristics and soil microbial properties (respiration and biomass) data were ln- transformed to meet assumptions of ANOVA. Linear mixed- effects models were performed using <i>lme4</i> package (Bates et al. 2015), whereas p-values and degrees of freedom were estimated with Type III Kenward-Roger approximation using <i>lmerTest </i>(Kuznetsova et al. 2017). We further used comparisons of means for treatment- specific effects (Tukey's HSD test; α &lt; 0.05). Tukey's tests were performed using and <i>multcomp</i> package (Hothorn et al. 2016). Bare plots were excluded from analysis, but their values are displayed in graphs.</p>

<p>To test the effects of duration of plant growth, community growth rates, and forb:grass ratios on bacterial and fungal community compositions, we first filtered out taxa that were present in less than ten samples and had an abundance of less than 0.01%. ITS sequences derived from other organisms than fungi were further removed and for 16S rRNA data mitochondria and chloroplast sequences were removed. For both bacteria and fungi, samples with less than 1000 reads of more than 80 000 reads remaining were removed from the dataset and read numbers were further normalized using total sum scaling (TSS). Mock communities consisting of 10 fungal species were used to inspect the filtering done for fungi. After filtering, we detected 13 fungal OTUs which shows that we might be slightly overestimating the diversity. Afterwards, we ran permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) (based on Bray–Curtis dissimilarities, 999 permutations) on both bacterial and fungal OTUs using the <i>""adonis""</i> function in the <i>vegan</i> package (Oksanen et al. 2016). However, here we only used one- and two-year subplots to test for the differences in plant community effect on soil microbial community composition. Since the basic assumption of PERMANOVA analysis is a balanced design and homogenization of samples, bare subplots were excluded due to lower number of samples than the one-and two-year subplots. For visualization we applied a nonmetric multidimensional (NMDS) analysis of the dissimilarities (based on Bray–Curtis dissimilarities) in microbial community composition using <i>ggplot2</i> package (Wickham 2016). All statistics were performed within the R statistical environment (Version 3.5.1; R Core Team, 2018).</p> <p>Changes in plant community composition can have long-lasting consequences for ecosystem functioning. However, how the duration of plant growth of functionally distinct grassland plant communities influences abiotic and biotic soil properties and thus ecosystem functions is poorly known. In a field experiment, we established identical experimental subplots in two successive years comprising of fast- or slow-growing grass and forb community mixtures with different forb:grass ratios. After one and two years of plant growth, we measured above- and belowground biomass, soil abiotic characteristics (pH, organic matter, soil nutrients), soil microbial properties (respiration, biomass, community composition), and nematode abundance. Fast- and slow-growing plant communities did not differ in above- and belowground biomass. However, fast-and slow-growing plant communities created distinct soil bacterial communities, whereas soil fungal communities differed most in 100% forb communities compared to other forb:grass ratio mixtures. Moreover, soil nitrate availability was higher after two years of plant growth, whereas the opposite was true for soil ammonium concentrations. Furthermore, total nematodes and especially bacterial-feeding nematodes were more abundant after two years of plant growth. Our results show that plant community composition is a driving factor in soil microbial community assembly and that the duration of plant growth plays a crucial role in the establishment of plant community and functional group composition effects on abiotic and biotic soil ecosystem functioning under natural field conditions.</p> <p>Funding provided by: Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246<br>Award Number: NWO VICI grant 865.14.006</p>","2020-09-01","9,7,8,3,4","location","no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","no","zenodo"

Quantifying how plant diversity affects decomposition is thus crucial for predicting the effect of the global decline in plant diversity on ecosystem functioning. Plant diversity could affect the decomposition process both directly through the diversity of the litter, and/or indirectly through the diversity of the host plant community and its affect on the decomposition environment. Using a biodiversity experiment with trees in which both functional and taxonomic diversity were explicitly manipulated independently, we tested the effects of the functional diversity and identity of the living trees separately and in combination with the functional diversity and identity of the decomposing litter on rates of litter decomposition and soil respiration. Plant traits, predominantly leaf chemical and physical traits, were correlated with both litter decomposition and soil respiration rates. Surface litter decomposition, quantified by mass loss in litterbags, was best explained by abundance-weighted mean trait values of tree species from which the litter was assembled (functional identity). In contrast, soil respiration, which includes decomposition of dissolved organic carbon and root respiration, was best explained by the variance in trait values of the host trees (functional diversity). This research provides insight into the effect of loss of tree diversity in forests on soil processes. Such understanding is essential to predicting changes in the global carbon budget brought on by biodiversity loss. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Surface litter decomposition, soil respiration as a function of Taxonomic diversity, functional diversity and functional identity<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">No.Sp – number of species

Empirical investigation using RADseq in a northern lacustrine fish","Data from: Do genetic drift and accumulation of deleterious mutations preclude adaptation? Empirical investigation using RADseq in a northern lacustrine fish  Understanding genomic signatures of divergent selection underlying long-term adaptation in populations located in heterogeneous environments is a key goal in evolutionary biology. In this study, we investigated neutral, adaptive and deleterious genetic variation using 7,192 SNPs in 31 Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) populations (n = 673) from Québec, Canada. Average genetic diversity was low, weakly shared among lakes, and positively correlated to lake size, indicating a major role for genetic drift subsequent to lake isolation. Putatively deleterious mutations were on average at lower frequencies than the other SNPs, and their abundance relative to the entire polymorphism in each population was positively correlated to inbreeding, suggesting that the effectiveness of purifying selection was negatively correlated to inbreeding, as predicted from theory. Despite evidence for pronounced genetic drift and inbreeding, several outlier loci were associated with temperature and found in or close to genes with biologically relevant functions notably related to heat-stress and immune responses. Outcomes of gene-temperature associations were influenced by the inclusion of the most inbred populations, in which allele frequencies deviated the most from model predictions. This result illustrates challenge in identifying gene-environment associations in cases of high genetic drift and restricted gene flow and suggests limited adaptation in populations experiencing higher inbreeding. We discuss the relevance of these findings for the conservation and management, notably regarding stocking and genetic rescue, of Lake Trout populations and other species inhabiting highly fragmented habitats. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">VCF file<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">VCFv4.0 file for the 673 Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) individuals from 31 populations from Quebec, Canada.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">MEC-17-0449.vcf<br></div></div> Genetic Canada; Quebec","2017-09-18","3,4,6",NA,"yes","H","repository",".vcf","not given","not given","Map, range coordinates","Salvelinus namaycush","2003-2013","2003","2013","source publication text","10","not given","500000","not given","EBV genetic analysis","NA","NA","Molecular Ecology","https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.14361","no","dryad"

<p>The study area included 40 farms distributed along a gradient of agricultural intensification covering approximately 10,200 km<sup>2</sup> in southern Québec, Canada. Three land cover types dominated the study system: low-intensity agricultural fields (i.e. hay, alfalfa (<i>Medicago sativa</i>), clover (<i>Trifolium</i> spp.), and pastures, henceforth referred to as ""forage crops""), intensive agricultural fields (i.e., annual row crops mainly composed of corn (<i>Zea mays</i>), soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), and wheat (<i>Triticum</i> spp.)) and forest.</p>

<p>Each farm included 10 identical nest boxes mostly arranged in a row along field margins and separated by at least 50 meters to limit intra and interspecific competition (see Ghilain and Bélisle 2008 for further details on the study system). A Thermochron iButton device was fixed on the outside of one nest box on each farm to record hourly ambient temperature (model DS1922L; Embedded Data Systems, Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, USA). A pluviometer collected precipitation data (millimeters of rainfall) on each farm. We used the mean daily temperature and mean daily rainfall between May 1 and May 15 to characterize spring climate. </p>

<p> </p>

<p><a name=""_Toc40692184""><u>Nest monitoring</u></a></p>

<p>We monitored nest boxes every other day from 2009 to 2018 starting in the first week of May. We recorded the occurrence of nest materials, the laying date (first egg), and the number of eggs, hatchlings and fledglings. Monitoring ended when all nestlings had fledged on a given farm, which occurred between June 15 and August 5 during the study. Nest boxes were cleared of any nest material and/or dead nestlings every year in October.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><u>Preference</u></p>

<p>Preference for each nest box was estimated for each year according to the occurrence of a laying event (at least one egg laid) and settlement date (Julian date at which nesting material was first observed).</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Because some early settlement dates were left-censored given that some boxes already contained nest material at the first visit (45% of all boxes), settlement dates were classified as either ""early"" or ""late"" with respect to the annual median settlement date. The category ""early"" included boxes with settlement dates preceding or equal to the annual median, which comprised nearly all (91.3%) left-censored dates. Overall, the average difference between the annual mean settlement dates categorized as ""early"" and ""late"" was 10.4 ± 2.9 days (mean ± SD). Nest boxes occupied by other species were excluded from analyses (<i>N</i> = 964 boxes between 2009 and 2018). Such exclusions were made possible, even in the absence of a laying event, because the material and shape of nests are very species specific. We are thus confident that the vast majority of nests included in the study were initiated by tree swallows. The ordinal preference variable featured three categories:</p>

<p>1: No laying event</p>

<p>2: Laying event and late settlement</p>

<p>3: Laying event and early settlement</p>

<p> </p>

<p><u>Habitat quality</u></p>

<p>We used two proxies of reproductive success: (1) the number of hatchlings produced in a nest box and (2) the proportion of hatchlings that successfully fledged in a nestbox (i.e., fledging success).</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a name=""_Toc40692186""><u>Landscape context</u></a></p>

<p>We characterized landscape habitat composition by measuring the relative cover of forest, perennial forage crops, as well as of water bodies and wetlands, within radii of respectively 100 m, 5 km and 10 km. We assessed landscape habitat composition up to the 500-m scale on a yearly basis in the field by visually identifying cultures and marginal habitats and delineating them using orthophotos (1:40,000). Characterization beyond the 500-m scale was based on a mosaic of yearly georeferenced classified optical and radar satellite images taken between 2011 and 2018 (pixel resolution 30 m <span style=""background:white;"">×</span> 30 m; Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) 2018). Only the year 2018 was used to assess water cover at the above range of scales because it showed better accuracy than the data of previous years (AAFC, 2020), and because the cover of large water bodies, as those covered by the data we used, did not vary significantly across years (e.g., median between-year correlation of yearly water cover between 2011 and 2018 was 0.90 at the 10-km scale).</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a name=""_Toc40692187""><u>Food availability</u></a></p>

<p>Two passive insect traps were installed on each farm around the first and second third of the nest box transect. Traps consisted of ~4-L yellow buckets placed 1.5 m above ground. They were filled with ~2 L of salty detergent solution to reduce surface tension and slow the growth of bacteria and fungi. Two transparent plexiglass screens were mounted perpendicularly to one another above each bucket to intercept flying insects (see Bellavance et al. 2018 and Garrett et al. 2021a for details). We collected the content of each trap on every visit to a farm (i.e., every other day) and conserved arthropods in 70% ethanol until processing. We sorted samples by removing arthropods unlikely to be preyed upon by tree swallows (i.e., bumble bees (<i>Bombus</i> spp.: Hymenoptera), June bugs (<i>Phyllophaga</i> spp.: Coleoptera), large spiders (Araneae, &gt; 0.5 cm body width), and caterpillars (Lepidoptera); Bellavance et al. 2018). The rest of the sample was dried at 50ºC for at least 48 hours before being weighed (Adam Equipment, model AAA250L, ± 0.0001 g). The mean daily dry biomass of arthropods collected between May 1 and May 15 was used as a proxy of yearly food availability on a given farm at the time of nest site selection.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><u>Heterospecific social information</u></p>

<p>House sparrows (<i>Passer domesticus</i>) are tree swallow's main nest-site competitors in our system and they initiate breeding before swallows return from their wintering grounds (Robillard, Garant and Bélisle, 2013). We evaluated the use of heterospecific social information through the number of nest boxes occupied by house sparrows on each farm in the current year. Nest boxes and house sparrow nests were visited every other day concurrently to tree swallow monitoring. Occupancy was determined by the presence of at least one egg, and only first clutches observed in each box were included since a nest box is rarely used by another species once house sparrows have built a nest therein.</p>

<p><a name=""_Toc40692189""></a></p>

<p><u>Conspecific social information</u></p>

<p>We defined two sources of social information regarding the future breeding success that an individual could expect to experience on a given farm: the density of tree swallows that bred on a farm during the previous year and the mean number of fledglings obtained by those breeders.</p>

<p> </p> <p>Animals are expected to select a breeding habitat using cues that should reflect, directly or not, the fitness outcome of the different habitat options. However, human-induced environmental changes can alter the relationships between habitat characteristics and their fitness consequences, leading to maladaptive habitat choices. The most severe case of such nonideal habitat selection is the ecological trap, which occurs when individuals prefer to settle in poor-quality habitats while better ones are available. Here we studied the adaptiveness of nest box selection in a tree swallow (<i>Tachycineta bicolor</i>) population breeding over a 10-year period in a network of 400 nest boxes distributed along a gradient of agricultural intensification in southern Québec, Canada. We first examined the effects of multiple environmental and social habitat characteristics on nest box preference to identify potential settlement cues. We then assessed the links between those cues and habitat quality as defined by the reproductive performance of individuals that settled early or late in nest boxes. We found that tree swallows preferred nesting in open habitats with high cover of perennial forage crops, high spring insect biomass, and high density of house sparrows (<i>Passer domesticus</i>), their main competitors for nest sites. They also preferred nesting where the density of breeders and their mean number of fledglings during the previous year were high. However, we detected mismatches between preference and habitat quality for several environmental variables. The density of competitors and conspecific social information showed severe mismatches, as their relationships to preference and breeding success went in opposite direction under certain circumstances. Spring food availability and agricultural landscape context, while related to preferences, were not related to breeding success. Overall, our study emphasizes the complexity of habitat selection behavior and provides evidence that multiple mechanisms may potentially lead to an ecological trap in farmlands. </p> <p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: </p><p>Funding provided by: Fonds de Recherche du Québec—Nature et technologies*<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: </p>","2022-11-04","3,7,5,6",NA,"yes","H","repository",".xlsx","sample coordinates","not given","no","Tachycineta bicolor, Passer domesticus","2009-2018","2009","2018","source link","10","source link","10200","source link","abundance, presence-absence, density","NA","NA","Authorea","https://doi.org/10.22541/au.161832268.87346989/v1","no","zenodo"

In this study, we contrast genomic variation in two salmonid species (anadromous Chinook Salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, 11,579 SNPs and resident Brook Charr Salvelinus fontinalis, 13,522 SNPs) with differing invasion success after introduction to new environments in South America relative to populations from their native range in North America. Estimates of genetic diversity were not significantly different between introduced and source populations for either species, indicative of propagule pressure that has been shown to maintain diversity in founding populations relative to their native range. Introduced populations also demonstrated higher connectivity and gene flow than those in their native range. Evidence for candidate loci under divergent selection was observed, but was limited to specific introduced populations and was not widely evident. Patterns of genomic variation were consistent with general dispersal potential of each species and therefore also the notion that life history variation may contribute to both invasion success and subsequent genetic structure of these two salmonids in Patagonia. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Chinook_Genotypes_11759SNPs<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Chinook salmon genotypes for 11,759 SNPs (GenePop format)</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Ots_11759_genepop.txt<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Brook_Genotypes_13522SNPs<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Brook charr genotypes for 13,522 SNPs (GenePop format)</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Sfo_13522_genepop.txt<br></div></div> Oncorhynchus tshawytscha; Salvelinus fontinalis; Holocene South America; Quebec; Columbia River; North America; Patagonia","2017-01-31","3,6","location","no","X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, Salvelinus fontinalis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA","NA","Evolutionary Applications","https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.12464","no","dryad"

Here, we examined spatial and temporal variation of genetic structure among 13 populations of the Lyme disease vector, the black-legged tick, in southern Quebec, where this tick species is currently expanding and Lyme disease is emerging. Our objective was to identify the primary mode of tick movement into Canada based on observed spatial and temporal genetic patterns. Upon genotyping ten microsatellite loci from 613 tick specimens, we found multiple genetic signatures of frequent long-distance dispersal events, supporting the hypothesis that migratory birds are the primary carriers of black-legged ticks into southern Quebec. When we compared results from analyses of pairwise differences among ticks collected from eight different sites at different years between 2011 and 2014, we found that genetic variation observed among tick individuals appeared to be better explained by collection year than sampling locality. This suggests that while cohorts of black-legged ticks can rapidly invade large areas across southern Quebec, they also appear to be undergoing frequent turnover. Finally, the amount of genetic variation in tick populations across our study area appeared to be related to their degree of establishment, with established populations displaying a lower amount of temporal genetic variation than adventitious ones. Given that Lyme disease infection risk in a region can be influenced by the relative presence of established and/or adventitious tick populations, our results are useful for understanding both the seasonality and spatial variation of Lyme disease. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Leo et al_JH_Electronic Supplementary Material<div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">FINAL_Leo et al_JH_Electronic Supplementary Material 2.xlsx<br></div></div> genetic turnover; Population structure and phylogeography; zoonotic disease emergence; Ixodes scapularis Canada; Quebec","2016-10-03","9,7,8,3,6",NA,"yes","M","repository",".xlsx","sample coordinates","not given","Map, geological feature me","black-legged tick","2011-2014","2011","2014","source link abstract, dataset, source publication text","3","not given","2080","source publication text","presence only, EBV genetic analysis","NA","NA","Journal of Heredity","https://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esw073","yes","dryad"

Even-aged silviculture based on short-rotation clearcuts had severely altered boreal forests. Silvicultural alternatives (e.g., continuous cover or retention forestry) has the potential to restore and protect the habitats and functions of boreal forests. These alternatives are however often restricted to structurally complex old-growth forest, which are particularly threatened by anthropogenic disturbances. Increasing the use of alternatives to even-aged silviculture in early-successional stands could help recruit more structurally complex forests, with characteristics closer to the old-growth. In this article, we therefore evaluate the potential for silvicultural alternatives to even-aged management in boreal forests that burned less than a century ago.</span></p>
<p><span>2. We analyzed 1085 field plots in a 243000 km<sup>2</sup> area situated in the boreal forest of eastern Canada. These plots burned 30 to 100 years before the survey and had not been subjected to previous or subsequent anthropogenic disturbance; they hence represent young primary forests. The main patterns of tree diameter distribution variation within the plots were identified using k-means clustering. Stand structure, tree species composition, and environmental variables that most explained the differences among the clusters were identified with a random forest model, and then compared using Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher's exact tests.</span></p>
<p><span>3.</span> <span>The majority (&gt;75 %) of the plots presented an irregular structure of stem diameters (i.e., non-normally distributed, with many small diameter trees). The understorey was generally dominated by black spruce (<em>Picea mariana</em> [Mill.] BSP), a shade-tolerant species. Irregular structures were observed in both forests of high and low productivity, implying that different processes (e.g., early regeneration, variable tree growth) can lead to observed early irregular structure. Regular structures were generally characterized by a higher productivity and abundance in hardwood species compared to the irregular structures. </span></p>
<p><span>4. <em>Synthesis and application</em>: Many boreal forests of eastern Canada progress towards an irregular structure in the decades following the last stand-replacing fire. A substantial part of these early-successional forests may be suitable for alternatives to even-aged silviculture that better maintains habitats and functions of preindustrial boreal forests. </span></p>  diameter distribution; forest structure; forest succession; Ecosystem-based Management; Ecological restoration; old-growth forest; Clearcuts; wildfire; Continuous-cover forestry; Close-to-nature silviculture","2022-04-27","0,3,4",NA,"yes","H","repository",".csv","sample coordinates","not given","Map","black spruce: Picea mariana; jack pine: Pinus banksiana; Balsam fir: Abies balsamea; broadleaved: Betula papyrifera and Populus tremuloides","1973-2016","1973","2016","source publication text","43","not given","243000","source link abstract, source publication text","density","NA","NA","Journal of Applied Ecology","NA","no","zenodo"

"23",23,"https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.31zcrjdp5","Water availability dictates how plant traits predict demographic rates","Water availability dictates how plant traits predict demographic rates <p><strong>Demographic Data </strong> We monitored growth and survival for eight graminoid and eight forb species in 24, 1-m° chart-quadrats from 1997 to 2010 at the Central Plains Experimental Research location (CPER) in Nunn, Colorado, USA (40.8 °N/110.8 °W). This North American shortgrass steppe is at 1650 m elevation and is dominated by Bouteloua gracilis and Bouteloua dactyloides. It receives an annual average of 340 mm of precipitation, and has a mean annual temperature of 8 °C (Chu et al. 2014) (Appendix S2: Section S1). The chart-quadrat method maps each plant in each year, but does not uniquely identify each individual. Plants with a sizeable basal area are mapped as polygons, while grasses and forbs with few stems are mapped as points. Graminoids in this analysis were measured as polygons, and forbs as points, so we use these functional groups in place of ""polygon"" or ""point."" Points representing forbs do not indicate plant size, so we can only measure growth for graminoids. We extracted growth and survival from a digitized version of this map dataset using ""tracking algorithms"" in R (version 4.0.3) (Lauenroth and Adler 2008, R Core Team 2021). These algorithms loop through the annual maps for a given quadrat, and assume that individuals of the same species growing in the same location in consecutive years are the same individual. In this way, the algorithms generate records of survival for all individuals, and records of growth or shrinkage for individuals measured as polygons. Individual plants can go dormant for up to several years, such that no above-ground material is visible. Individuals were allowed to be 'dormant' for up to one year. These tracking scripts allow for a user-defined period of dormancy, which we set to the conservative limit of one year. This means that if an individual is present in year one, absent in year two, but present in year three at the same coordinates as year one, this plant is considered the same individual. We also allowed a ""buffer"" of 5 cm in observations of the same individual from year to year, which accounts for measurement error as well as true variation in re-sprouting location across years (Fair et al. 1999, Lauenroth and Adler 2008, Chu et al. 2014). </p>
<p><strong>Trait Data</strong> We measured leaf and root traits for the 16 species in the demographic dataset. Five to ten mature, healthy individuals of each species were sampled for each trait. A majority of the values used in this analysis were collected at the CPER. However, several additional species were measured at the USDA-ARS High Plains Grasslands Research Station (HPGRS), a northern mixed-grass prairie 60 km from the CPER. In most cases, trait samples were collected from CPER and HPGRS between 2014 and 2018, and the associated data has been published (Blumenthal et al. 2020). For species without trait data from CPER or HPGRS, we used species-level trait values measured in 2018 and 2019 at Hays, KS, Miles City, MT and Dubois, ID. We calculated species mean values for seven traits: specific leaf area (SLA), leaf and root dry matter content (LDMC and RDMC), leaf turgor loss point (TLP), specific root length (SRL), average root diameter (RDiam), and root tissue density (RTD). SLA and LDMC were measured using standard methods (Pérez-Harguindeguy et al. 2013). TLP was calculated from measurements of leaf osmotic potential at full turgor made using a Vapro 5600 osmometer (Bartlett et al. 2012). TLP was derived from osmotic potential using the following equations: graminoid leaf turgor loss point = 0.944*(leaf osmotic potential) – 0.622, forb leaf turgor loss point = 0.80*(leaf osmotic potential) – 0.845 (Griffin-Nolan et al. 2019). Below ground traits were measured for fine, absorptive root tissue (typically 1st-3rd order roots) (McCormack et al. 2015). Intact absorptive root branches were extracted from soil monoliths that were sampled to 20 cm beneath the soil surface (Blumenthal et al., unpublished). Root length, average diameter, and root volume were measured using WinRhizo software (Regent Instruments, Inc., Ville de Québec, QC Canada). Further details of leaf trait sampling and measurement protocols can be found in (Blumenthal et al. 2020).</p> <p>A major goal in ecology is to make generalizable predictions of organism responses to environmental variation based on their traits. However, straightforward relationships between traits and fitness are rare and likely vary with environmental context. Characterizing how traits mediate demographic responses to the environment may enhance predictions of organism responses to global change. We synthesized 15 years of demographic data and species-level traits in a shortgrass steppe to determine whether the effects of leaf and root traits on growth and survival depend on seasonal water availability. We predicted that (1) species with drought-tolerant traits, such as lower leaf turgor loss point (TLP) and higher leaf and root dry matter content (LDMC and RDMC), would be more likely to survive and grow in drier years due to higher wilting resistance, (2) these traits would not predict fitness in wetter years, and (3) traits that more directly measure physiological mechanisms of water use such as TLP would best predict demographic responses. We found that graminoids with more negative TLP and higher LDMC and RDMC had higher survival rates in drier years. Forbs demonstrated similar yet more variable responses. Graminoids grew larger in wetter years, regardless of traits. However, in both wet and dry years, graminoids with more negative TLP and higher LDMC and RDMC grew larger than less negative TLP and low LDMC and RDMC species. Traits significantly mediated the impact of drought on survival, but not growth, suggesting survival could be a stronger driver of species' drought response in this system. TLP predicted survival in drier years, but easier-to-measure LDMC and RDMC were equal or better predictors. These results advance our understanding of the mechanisms by which drought drives population dynamics, and show that abiotic context determines how traits drive fitness.</p> <p><strong>Demographic Data</strong> The demographic data is in two files: one for that has data for species measured as points (forbs), and another that has data for species measured as polygons (graminoids).

Studies of biodiversity-ecosystem function in treed ecosystems have generally focused on aboveground functions. The present study investigates inter-trophic links between tree diversity and soil microbial community function and composition.We examined how microbial communities in surface mineral soil responded to experimental gradients of tree species richness (SR), functional diversity (FD), community-weighted mean trait value (CWM) and tree identity. The site was a 4-yr-old common garden experiment near Montreal, Canada, consisting of deciduous and evergreen tree species mixtures. Microbial community composition, community-level physiological profiles (CLPP) and respiration were evaluated using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and the MicroRespTM system, respectively. The relationship between tree species richness and glucose induced respiration (GIR), basal respiration (BR), metabolic quotient (qCO2) followed a positive but saturating shape. Microbial communities associated with species mixtures were more active (basal respiration (BR)), with higher biomass (glucose induced respiration (GIR)), and used a greater number of carbon sources than monocultures. Communities associated with deciduous tree species used a greater number of carbon sources than those associated with evergreen species, suggesting a greater soil carbon storage capacity. There were no differences in microbial composition (PLFA) between monocultures and SR mixtures. The FD and the CWM of several functional traits affected both BR and GIR. In general, the CWM of traits had stronger effects than did FD, suggesting that certain traits of dominant species have more effect on ecosystem processes than does FD. Both the functions of GIR and BR were positively related to aboveground tree community productivity. Both tree diversity (SR) and identity (species and functional identity – leaf habit) affected soil microbial community respiration, biomass and composition. For the first time, we identified functional traits related to life history strategy, as well as root traits that influence another trophic level, soil microbial community function, via effects on BR and GIR. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Montreal_IDENT_2012_SMC<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">The data are associated to the publication ""Do temperate tree species diversity and identity influence soil microbial community function and composition?"" by Khlifa, Rim, Paquette, Alain, Messier, Christian, Reich, Peter, Munson, Alison.

Sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marshall) reaches its northern continuous distributional limit in north-eastern North America at the transition between boreal mixed-wood and temperate deciduous forests. We hypothesized that marginal fragmented northern populations from the boreal mixed-wood would have a distinct pattern of genetic structure and diversity. We analyzed 18 microsatellite loci variation in 23 populations distributed along three latitudinal transects (west, central and east) that encompass the continuous-discontinuous species range. Each transect was divided into two zones, continuous (temperate deciduous) and discontinuous (boreal mixed-wood), based on sugar maple stand abundance. Respective positive and negative relationships were found between the distance of each population to the northern limit (D north), and allelic richness (AR) and population differentiation (FST). These relations were tested for each transect separately; the pattern (discontinuous/continuous) remained significant only for the western transect. structure analysis revealed the presence of four clusters. The most northern populations of each transect were assigned to a distinct group. Asymmetrical gene flow occurred from the southern into the four northernmost populations. Southern populations in Québec may have originated from two different postglacial migration routes. No evidence was found to validate the hypothesis that northern populations were remnants of a larger population that had migrated further north of the species range after the retreat of the ice sheet. The northernmost sugar maple populations possibly originated from long distance dispersal. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">AcerSaccharum-18ssr-Lat-23pop<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Microsatellites data from 18 markers on 23 sugar maple populations across the northern limit of the species in Québec, Canada.

First, we conducted the most comprehensive analysis of neutral genetic population structure to date in order to revisit the null hypothesis of panmixia in this species. Second, we used this data to provide the first estimates of contemporary effective population size (Ne) and to document temporal variation in effective number of breeders (Nb) in American eel. Third, we tested for statistical associations between temporal variation in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, the effective number of breeders and two indices of recruit abundance. A total of 2142 eels from 32 sampling locations were genotyped with 18 microsatellite loci. All measures of differentiation were essentially zero, and no evidence for significant spatial or temporal genetic differentiation was found. The panmixia hypothesis should thus be accepted for this species. Nb estimates varied by a factor of 23 among 12 cohorts, from 473 to 10 999. The effective population size Ne was estimated to be around 22 382. This study also showed that genetically based demographic indices, namely Nb and allelic richness (Ar), can be used as surrogates for the abundance of breeders and recruits, which were both shown to be positively influenced by variation during high (positive) NAO phases. Thus, long-term genetic monitoring of American glass eels at several sites along the North American Atlantic coast would represent a powerful and efficient complement to census monitoring to track demographic fluctuations and better understand their causes. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">genotype_age_location_Dryad2012<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">American glass eels recruitment begins in Florida around December and progresses northward to Newfoundland–Labrador until June/July (Helfman et al. 1987). The first waves of glass eels at each location were sampled in 2008 following this latitudinal trend at 17 sites evenly distributed along eastern North America up to the St. Lawrence estuary. For each location, 50 individuals were measured and preserved in 95% ethanol. Yellow eels were also collected between May and September 2008 at 15 locations ranging from the upper St. Lawrence River to the Atlantic coast of Canada. The emphasis on yellow eel sampling in this region was motivated by the occurrence of strikingly different recruitment trends reported between Atlantic Canada versus the upper St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario (Cairns et al. 2008). Sample size varied from 69 to 100 yellow eels per location. Fin clips were preserved in 95% ethanol for DNA extraction and genotyping, and heads were kept for otolith extraction. Yellow Eels collected in 2007 were finally rejected since they were frozen before being preserved in ethanol, wich caused a bias in microsattelits amplification. AGE DETERMINATION: Age was determined for 946 yellow eels, which allowed us to subdivide them into annual cohorts. Sagittal otoliths were extracted, stored in glass vials in a 95% ethanol: glycerine solution (1 : 1 ratio), and cleaned with successive baths of bleach, water, and 95% ethanol. Once dried, otoliths were embedded in a mix of epoxy resin and hardener (4:1 ratio) inside gelatine capsules for 24 h, ground to the core on the sagittal plane, and polished with alumina powder on a polishing disc. Sections were etched, decalcified in 5% EDTA for annuli enhancing, stained in 0.01% toluidine blue solution, and digitally photographed (e.g., Tremblay 2009). The first annulus after the dark central nucleus was considered as the elver check (metamorphosis from leptochephalus larva to glass eel) and subsequent annuli as winter checks (e.g., ICES 2011). Eels were considered by convention to be of age 0 + in their year of arrival in continental waters, and their ""cohort year"" was thus defined as so. Each otolith was aged twice by two eel experts to confirm aging. A total of 946 yellow eel otoliths were readable, representing 17 different cohorts, each comprising 1 to 127 individuals.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Abondance index variation and North Atlantic Oscillation Index<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">We tested for statistical associations among several combinations of the NAO time series and temporal fluctuations of three variables used as proxies of relative abundance. Variation in Nb was used as a proxy for relative variation in the number of breeders. Allelic richness (Ar), measured for each cohort, was used as a proxy for the relative abundance of recruits since it has previously been proposed to correlate with offspring recruitment (McCusker &amp; Bentzen 2010). YCSI was used as a second proxy of recruit abundance. We first tested for pairwise correlations between Nb, Ar, and YCSI, and time series of these three parameters were then compared with the monthly normalized NAO (http://www.cgd.ucar.edu). The ""corresponding year"" between time series represented the year when glass eels reached the continent for the Ar, Nb, and YCSI time series. To test environmental influence on previous life stages, +2 to -2 year lags were also tested. To assess the statistical significance of climate influence on eel abundance, multivariate models were run where the explanatory variables considered were the NAO time series. Stepwise regressions of the three relative abundance variables (Nb, Ar, and YCSI) were fitted to the explanatory variables to determine which ones were significant. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used to select models. Cross-validation R2 was computed to determine the prediction strength of the selected model and semi-partial R2 were computed to assess the relative importance of each selected variable.

<p>2. Here, we examine the effects of changed precipitation and air temperature, and defoliation intensity on root length dynamics and aboveground biomass using the third year data from a multifactor experiment conducted across three northern temperate grasslands.</p>

<p>3. We found that root length was more sensitive to the changes in environmental and management conditions than root mass, demonstrating the importance of root length as an indicator of rapid root system changes. Across all sites, warming, altered precipitation, and defoliation intensity interacted to affect root length while aboveground biomass was only affected by defoliation intensity, indicating that the root system was more responsive than aboveground biomass when climatic conditions change. Overall, drought reduced root length, particularly under low defoliation intensity, as well as in combination with warming and heavy defoliation, highlighting the risk of additive effects of such environmental stresses. Across unclipped plots, aboveground biomass was positively associated with total root length, the latter of which further interacted with precipitation, to affect aboveground biomass. Compared to defoliated communities, non-defoliated plant communities exhibited a greater ability to maintain aboveground biomass under drought conditions via increases in root system efficiency (the amount of aboveground biomass produced per unit of root length invested).</p>

<p>4. Our results highlight the rapid change of root length in the face of interactive stressors. We postulate that the degree of stability in aboveground biomass is driven by the altered root system dynamics or species turnover.

Eastern Wolves, a species at risk in Canada, are centralized in Algonquin Provincial Park and their ability to disperse and establish themselves elsewhere is limited by human-caused mortality associated with hunting, trapping, and vehicle collisions. Here, we refine our understanding of Eastern Wolf distribution and provide the first estimates of their effective population size. Location: Southern Ontario and Gatineau Quebec. Methods: We used noninvasive samples, as well as blood samples archived from other research projects, collected between 2010 – 2014 to generate autosomal microsatellite genotypes at 12 loci for 98 Canis individuals. We utilized Bayesian and multivariate clustering analyses to identify Eastern Wolves in regions that were previously unsampled. Both linkage disequilibrium and temporal approaches were used to estimate effective population size of Eastern Wolves.  Results: Assignment tests identified 34 individuals as Eastern Wolves, primarily in or near two provincial parks: Killarney and Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands. Eastern Coyotes were identified in Bon Echo Provincial Park, Frontenac Provincial Park, and Gatineau Park, whereas many of the samples were admixed among the different Canis types. Effective population size (Ne) estimates ranged from 24.3 – 122.1 with a harmonic mean of 45.6.  Main Conclusions: The identification of Eastern Wolves in the regions of Killarney and Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands Provincial Parks extends the range of Eastern Wolves north of the French River and southward into previously unidentified regions. The effective population size is low and raises concerns for long-term persistence of this threatened carnivore; values are dangerously close to critical values recommended for short-term persistence.

As such, species of the Ericaceae family have a major effect on the regeneration of tree species in boreal ecosystems. It is thus imperative to understand the ecological gradients controlling their distribution and abundance, so that their impacts can be taken into account in sustainable forest management. Using innovative analytical techniques from landscape ecology, we aimed to position, along ecological gradients, four Ericaceae found in the boreal forest of Quebec (Canada) (Rhododendron groenlandicum, Kalmia angustifolia, Chamaedaphne calyculata, and Vaccinium spp), to regionalize these species into landscape units relevant to forest management, and to estimate the relative importance of several ecological drivers (climate, disturbances, stand attributes, and physical environment) that control the species distribution and abundance. We conducted our study in boreal Quebec, over a study area covering 535,355 km2. We used data from 15,339 ecological survey plots and forest maps to characterize 1422 ecological districts covering the study region. We evaluated the relative proportion of each ericaceous species and explanatory variables at the district level. Vegetation and explanatory variables matrices were used to conduct redundancy, cluster, and variation partitioning analyses. We observed that ericaceous species are mainly distributed in the western part of the study area and each species has a distinct latitudinal and longitudinal gradient distribution. On the basis of these gradients, we delimited 10 homogeneous landscape units distinct in terms of ericaceous species abundance and environmental drivers. The distribution of the ericaceous species along ecological gradients is closely related to the overlaps between the four sets of explanatory variables considered. We conclude that the studied Ericaceae occupy specific positions along ecological gradients and possess a specific abundance and distribution controlled by the integration of multiple explanatory variables. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Data_ThiffaultEtAl_EcoEvo<div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div> Kalmia angustifolia; Anthropocene; redundancy analysis; Rhododendron groenlandicum; landscape ecology; Vaccinium angustifolium; Chamaedaphne calyculata; Vaccinium myrtilloides; ecological drivers 53N; Canada; 58W; Quebec; 47N; 80W","2016-03-11","0,3,4",NA,"yes","H","repository",".csv","not given","not given","Map","Rhododendron groenlandicum, Kalmia angustifolia, Chamaedaphne calyculata, Vaccinium spp","1986-2000","1986","2000","source publication text","20","not given","535355","source link abstract, source publication text","abundance","NA","NA","Ecology and Evolution","https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.1476","no","dryad"

Studying the fine-scale responses of individuals to broad-scale changes in ice availability and phenology would help to understand how animals react to ongoing climate change, and contribute to the conservation and management of endangered species living in northern environments.

Here, we used molecular parentage analysis to assess the reproductive success of wild- and hatchery- born Atlantic salmon over three consecutive years in a small river in Québec. Yearly restocking in this river follows a single generation of captive breeding. Among the adults returning to the river to spawn, between 11% and 41% each year were born in hatchery. Their relative reproductive success (RRS) was nearly half that of wild-born fish (0.55). RRS varied with life stage, being 0.71 for fish released at the fry stage and 0.42 for fish released as smolt. The lower reproductive success of salmon released as smolt was partly mediated by modification of the proportion of single-sea-winter/multi-sea-winter fish. Overall, our results suggest that modifications in survival and growth rates alter the life-history strategies of these fish at the cost of their reproductive success. Our results underline the potential fitness decrease, warn on long-term evolutionary consequences for the population of repeated stocking and support the adoption of more natural rearing conditions for captive juveniles and their release at a younger stage, such as unfed fry. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">MILOTEVA2012DATA<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Genotypes at 8 microsatellite loci (coded by three digits) of adults and juveniles Salmo salar sampled in the Malbaie River from 2002 to 2005 and and at the local hatchery (order explained in the first line of the file).</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div> Captive Populations; Salmo salar; Conservation Biology Canada; Quebec; Malbaie River; La Malbaie","2012-10-08","3,6",NA,"yes","L","repository",".txt","not given","geological feature me","geological feature me","Atlantic salmon","2002-2004","2002","2004","source publication text","2","not given","not given","NA","EBV genetic analysis","NA","NA","Evolutionary Applications","https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.12028","yes","dryad"

Phenotype-habitat correlations arise either through phenotypes within an environment altering through the process of natural selection or plasticity, or phenotypes remaining constant but individuals altering their distribution across environments. The mechanisms of non-random movement and phenotype-dependent habitat choice may account for associations within highly heterogeneous systems, such as streams, where local adaptation may be negated, plasticity too costly and movement is particularly important. Despite growing attention, however, few empirical tests have yet to be conducted. Here we provide a test of phenotype-dependent habitat choice and ask: 1) if individuals collected from a single habitat type continue to select original habitat; 2) if decisions are phenotype-dependent and functionally related to habitat requirements; and 3) if phenotypic-sorting continues despite increasing population density. To do so we both conducted experimental trials manipulating the density of four stream-fish species collected from either a single riffle or pool and developed a game-theoretical model exploring the influence of individuals' growth rate, sampling and competitive abilities as well as interference on distribution across two habitats as a function of density. Our experimental trials show individuals selecting original versus alternative habitats differed in their morphologies, that morphologies were functionally related to habitat-type swimming demands, and that phenotypic-sorting remained significant (although decreased) as density increased. According to our model this only occurs when phenotypes have contrasting habitat preferences and only one phenotype disperses (i.e. selects alternatives) in response to density pressures. This supports our explanation that empirical habitat selection was due to a combination of collecting a fraction of mobile individuals with different habitat preferences and the exclusion of individuals via scramble competition at increased densities. Phenotype-dependent habitat choice can thereby account for observed patterns of natural stream-fish distribution. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">DataJacobsonetal2017<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">This file contains the density level, trial, selected habitat, partial warp and length and size variables for each of the individuals and species tested within artificial stream experiments.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div> Cottus bairdi; non-random dispersal; Rhinichthys atratulus; phenotypic-sorting; Etheostoma nigrum; Semotilus atromaculatus; stream-fishes","2017-06-02","3,8,6,10","non-field experiment","no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA","NA","NA","https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.04126","no","zenodo"

However, selection cannot constrain reaction norms for environmental conditions that populations have not experienced. This may allow cryptic neutral genetic variation for the reaction norm to accumulate such that a release of phenotypic variation occurs when it is exposed to novel conditions. Most genomic diversity behaves as if functionally neutral. Genome-wide diversity metrics may therefore correlate with levels of cryptic genetic variation and, as a result, could exhibit a positive relationship with a release of phenotypic variation in novel environments. To test this hypothesis, we conducted translocations of juvenile brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) from 12 populations to novel uninhabited ponds that represented a gradient of environmental conditions. We assessed reaction norms for morphological traits (body size and four morphometric relative warps) across pond environmental gradients and evaluated the effect of genome-wide heterozygosity on phenotypic variability. All traits displayed plastic reaction norms. Overall, we found some evidence that a release of phenotypic variation consistent with cryptic genetic variation can occur in novel environmental conditions. However, the extent to which this release was correlated with average genome-wide diversity was limited to only one of five morphological traits examined. Our results suggest that the link between genomic diversity and the accumulation of cryptic genetic variation in reaction norms may be limited. Similarly, reaction norms were constrained for many of the morphological traits examined. Past conditions may have constrained reaction norms in the putatively novel environments despite significant deviations from contemporary source population habitat.

As such, identifying the potential pathways of invasion, especially in places with emerging populations, is critical for preventing new or continued invasion. Wild pigs have been reported in Ontario, Canada in recent years. We tested four non-exclusive hypotheses about the source of wild pigs in Ontario: 1) escapees from captive sources within Ontario; 2) invasion from neighboring jurisdictions; 3) existing wild populations within Ontario; and 4) translocation and illegal release. We found that sightings of Eurasian wild boar were closer to premises with wild boar than were random locations; wild boar sightings were an average of 16.3 km (SD = 25.4 km, min = 0.2 km, n = 20) from premises with wild boar. We also found that sightings of domestic pigs were closer to domestic pig farms than expected. Sightings of wild pigs in groups of more than four animals were rare. Our results suggest that wild pigs observed in Ontario are recent escapes from captivity, recognizing that there may be established groups of wild pigs that we have not yet detected. While not common, we also received reports indicating that in the past, wild pigs have been translocated and illegally released. Other North American jurisdictions that have been successful at eliminating wild pigs have removed existing populations and changed regulations to limit future invasion, such as prohibiting possession and transport of wild boar and prohibiting hunting of wild pigs.</p> <p>Two dataframes within Rdata:<br>

Protected areas help safeguard the landscape from additional anthropogenic disturbances and, when properly designed, can help species cope with climate change impacts. When designed to protect the regional biodiversity rather than to conserve focal species or landscape elements, protected areas need to cover a representative sample of the regional biodiversity and be functionally connected, facilitating individual movements among protected areas in a network to maximize their effectiveness. We developed a methodology to define effective protected areas to implement in a regional network using ecological representativeness and functional connectivity as criteria. We illustrated this methodology in the Gaspésie region of Québec, Canada.

Only a few protected areas among those available were repeatedly chosen in the most effective networks.

Recently, evidence has emerged suggesting that intraspecific variation might have a potentially large role in driving functional community composition and response to environmental change. However, empirical evidence quantifying the respective importance of phenotypic plasticity and genetic differentiation relative to species turnover is still lacking. We performed a reciprocal transplant experiment using a common herbaceous plant species (Oxalis montana) among low-, mid-, and high-elevation sites to first quantify the contributions of plasticity and genetic differentiation in driving intraspecific variation in three traits: height, specific leaf area and leaf area. We next compared the contributions of these intraspecific drivers of community trait-environment matching to that of species turnover, which had been previously assessed along the same elevational gradient. Plasticity was the dominant driver of intraspecific trait variation across elevation in all traits, with only a small contribution of genetic differentiation among populations. Local adaptation was not detected to a major extent along the gradient. Fitness components were greatest in O. montana plants with trait values closest to the local community-weighted means, thus supporting the common assumption that community-weighted mean trait values represent selective optima. Our results suggest that community-level trait responses to ongoing climate change should be mostly mediated by species turnover, even at the small spatial scale of our study, with an especially small contribution of evolutionary adaptation within species. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Trait and fitness measurements of Oxalis montana in transplant experiment; Plastic and genetic drivers of community turnover<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Measurements of height, leaf area, specific leaf area (SLA) on individuals of Oxalis montana from a reciprocal transplant experiment along an elevational gradient.

Prezygotic and postzygotic barriers impacting a native poplar hybrid stand.  Hybridization and introgression are pervasive evolutionary phenomena that provide insight to the selective forces that maintain species boundaries, permit gene flow and control the direction of evolutionary change. Poplar trees (Populus L.) are well known for their ability to form viable hybrids and maintain their distinct species boundaries despite this interspecific gene flow. We sought to quantify the hybridization dynamics and postzygotic fitness within a hybrid stand of balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.), eastern cottonwood (P. deltoides Marsh.) and their natural hybrids to gain insight to the barriers maintaining this stable hybrid zone. We observed asymmetrical hybrid formation with P. deltoides acting as the seed parent, but with subsequent introgression biased towards P. balsamifera. Native hybrids expressed fitness traits intermediate to the parental species and were not universally unfit. That said, native hybrid seedlings were absent from the seedling population, which may indicate additional selective pressures controlling their recruitment. It is imperative that we understand the selective forces maintaining this native hybrid zone in order to quantify the impact of exotic poplar hybrids on this native system. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">R code for analysis of fitness data<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">All R code associated with the manuscript are included.

Although changes in animal communities following disturbances have been widely examined, few studies have investigated the mechanisms structuring communities during ecological succession. We assessed the impact of logging on small mammal and beetle assemblages in landscapes dominated by old-growth boreal forests. Our objectives were to 1) characterize variations in communities during the first 66 years of post-harvest forest succession, 2) determine if there are non-random patterns of species co-occurrence (i.e., deterministic processes), and if there are, 3) establish whether non-random co-occurrences are best explained by habitat attributes or by interspecific interactions. We captured small mammals and beetles along a gradient of forest succession (5-66 years) and in old-growth forest, and characterized key vegetation attributes. First, we tested whether community compositions in clear-cut stands became similar to those in natural stands after 66 years. We then used null models, which were either unconstrained or constrained by habitat attributes, to address the last two objectives and distinguish effects of vegetation attributes from interspecific interactions on community assembly. We showed that beetle assemblages differed in stands 21-30 years post-harvest compared to old-growth forests. In contrast, harvesting did not influence the composition of small mammal communities. Overall, our results suggest that community assembly during forest succession is driven by both stochastic and deterministic processes, the latter being linked to interspecific interactions more strongly than to vegetation attributes. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">2007_2011_small_mammals_vegetation<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Small mammals were sampled in 53 sites in 2007 (37 logged stands, and 16 old-growth forests) and 34 sites in 2011 (17 logged stands and 17 old-growth forests).

Agricultural intensification in the breeding range is often regarded as one of the main drivers of these declines. Here, we tested the hypothesis that body mass in breeding individuals should reflect habitat quality in an aerial insectivore, the tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), along a gradient of agricultural intensity. Our dataset was collected over 7 years (2005–2011) and included 2918 swallow captures and 1483 broods. Analyses revealed a substantial decline of the population over the course of the study (−19% occupancy rate), mirrored by decreasing body mass. This trend was especially severe in females, representing a total loss of 8% of their mass. Reproductive success was negatively influenced by intensive agriculture, but did not decrease over time. Interestingly, variation in body mass was independent of breeding habitat quality, leading us to suggest that this decline in body mass may result from carry-over effects from non-breeding areas and affect population dynamics through reduced survival. This work contributes to the growing body of evidence suggesting that declines in migratory aerial insectivores are driven by multiple, complex factors requiring better knowledge of year-round habitat use. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Female data<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Dataset comprising all captures of female tree swallows used in the study between 2005-2011.

Little is known about the incidence of physiological convergence in natural populations, so here we test whether energy metabolism in 'dwarf' and 'normal' Lake Whitefish evolves by similar mechanisms. Prior genomic and transcriptomic studies have found that divergence in energy metabolism is key to local adaptation in whitefish species pairs, but that distinct genetic and transcriptomic changes often underlie phenotypic evolution among lakes. Here, we predicted that traits at higher levels of biological organization, including the activities of energy metabolism enzymes (the product of enzyme concentration and turnover rate) and the relative proportions of metabolically active tissues (heart, liver, skeletal muscle), would show greater convergence than genetic and transcriptomic variation. We compared four whitefish species pairs and found convergence in organ size whereby all dwarf whitefish populations have a higher proportion of red skeletal muscle, three have relatively larger livers and two have relatively larger ventricles than normal fish. On the other hand, hepatic and muscle enzyme activities showed little convergence and were largely dependent on lake of origin. Only the most genetically divergent species pair (Cliff Lake) displayed white muscle enzyme activities matching results from laboratory-reared normal and dwarf whitefish. Overall, these data show convergence in the evolution of organ size, but not in the activities of candidate enzymes of energy metabolism, which may have evolved mainly as a consequence of demographic or ecological differences among lakes. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Dalziel_2016_RawData<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">File with all raw data and notes on sample collection.

The nature of this event creates a natural scenario to test vicariance, divergence, and speciation by allopatry. Studies have shown the effect of the CAI on marine and terrestrial species, but none have examined a large-bodied amphibious taxon. We used RAD sequencing on populations of the American crocodile <em>Crocodylus acutus</em>, to study the genomic variation of <em>C. acutus</em> on both sides of the CAI, infer its demographic history and measure the effect of the opening of the Panama Canal. Our results showed three genomic clusters: 1) Caribbean and the Panama Canal, 2) Pacific coast, and 3) Coiba island. The estimated divergence times between the Caribbean and Pacific populations are about 20 ka, which is two orders of magnitude younger than the formation of the CAI, but coincides with the Last Glacial Maximum. We hypothesize the glacial/interglacial cycles facilitated gene flow between the Caribbean and Pacific crocodile populations after the formation of the CAI, masking any genomic divergence the CAI may have caused.

We sampled in permanent plots established under the revised Gentry protocol (Phillips et al., 2003). Two 2 ha plots were established in each of the three main forest habitats: terra-firme (clay-rich soils), white-sand and seasonally flooded bottomlands. These habitats differ in topography, hydrography and soil nutrient availability (Allié et al., 2015; Guitet<i> </i>et al., 2015)</p>

<p style=""text-indent:.5in;"">For root morphological analyses, we used five randomly selected 5-10 cm long root systems comprised of the three most distal root orders (Xia et al. 2010). Roots were weighed to the nearest 0.01mg, scanned with a flat-top digital scanner (600 DPI resolution, 256-level gray-scale, TIFF format; Epson Scanner Perfection V700 Photo, USA), dried at 65 °C for 48 hr, and then reweighed. Image analysis of the scanned roots was performed using WinRhizo software (2007 Pro version, Instrument Regent, Quebec, Canada) to estimate specific root tip abundance (SRTA, tips mg<sup>-1</sup> DRM, (Meinen et al. 2009)), Branchiness Index (BI, tips/total length in cm, Eissenstat et al. 2015), average diameter, specific root length (SRL, m g<sup>-1</sup> DRM) and root tissue density (RTD, g DRM cm<sup>-3</sup>) for each sampled tree.</p>

<p><b><i>Anatomical preparation and trait measurements—</i></b>Transversal cut sections were randomly selected on the most distal root segments, using fully formed acquisition roots. Root maturity was visually determined by the presence of root cortex and fully formed vascular tissue. A paraffin embedding protocol was necessary to assist cutting and was adapted from Morel (2013, see Table S4). We cut sections from 8 to 25 µm using a rotating microtome (Leica Rotation Microtome, RM 2255; Leica, Vienna, Austria). We dissolved the remaining paraffin with heating the blade at 56°C (Premiere slide warmer, XH-2002; Daigger, Vernon Hills, IL, USA) and covering the blade with Mounting media.</p>

<p style=""text-indent:.5in;"">We captured the images of the sections with an Olympus Microscope BX60 (Olympus Optical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with an Olympus camera 750D. The microscopic observation was aided by a mercury lamp light source (Olympus, U-RFL-T) – allowing the distinction of lignified tissue. Measures of the tissues areas – root cortex area, root stele area, and root section area – were done using a previous image treatment with Adobe Photoshop CS5 (Photoshop CS3; Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, California, U.S.A.). Each tissue was isolated on a single image layer. The area of each layer was automatically calculated using a Java script on ImageJ2 software (Rueden et al.<i>,</i> 2017). Liner measurements of the stele and the tissue outside the stele (ToS) was estimated using the square root of the total area of each tissue divided by p.  </p>

<p><b><i>Global data set compilation—</i></b>We collected a global dataset of absorptive root traits (root diameter, RTD and SRL) for woody species. The criteria for the selection of papers included: 1) The study focused on absorptive root tissues, either first order or lateral root clusters with diameter &lt; 2mm; 2) the study included the measurement of the three root traits for at least five woody species; 3) the study was performed on woody plants in forested areas, excluding arid and alpine ecosystems; and 4) the study measured individuals growing in natural conditions or outdoor collections (see Supplementary Data 1). In total, we included 20 studies encompassing 697 entries, including 582 species of trees and understory shrubs. A total of 333 entries corresponded to temperate trees, followed by 228 subtropical and 136 tropical species. In terms of phylogenetic representation, Rosids (including Saxifragales and Vitales, <i>sensu</i> Soltis et al<i>.</i> 2003) were the most dominant group representing 51% of the species (ranging from 58% in the tropics to 53% and 43% in temperate and subtropical forests respectively). Asterids (including Caryophyllales and Santalales, Manchester et al. 2015) represented 23%, Magnoliids 16% and Gymnosperms 9% of the total number of species.     </p> <p>Studying the organization of functional traits in plant leaves and stems has revealed notable patterns linking function and form; however, evidence of similarly robust organization in root tissues remains controversial. We posit that anatomical traits in roots can provide insight on the overall organization of the root system. We hypothesize that A) size variation in the tissue outside the stele relates in a non-linear fashion with functional traits associated with direct resource uptake, including a negative relationship with root architectural traits; and B) similar relationships detected in tropical areas also hold true in other biomes.</p>

<p>We address our hypotheses using empirical data from 24 tropical tree species in French Guiana, including anatomical measurements in first order roots, and functional trait description for the entire fine root system. In addition, we compiled a global meta-analysis of root trait with 500+ forest species across tropical, subtropical and temperate forests.</p>

<p>Our results supported the expected non-linear relationships between cortical size and morphological traits, and a negative linear trend with architectural traits. We confirmed a global negative relationship between SRL, diameter and tissue density, suggesting similar anatomical constraints in root systems across woody plants. However the importance of factors vary across biomes, possibly related to the unequal phylogenetic representation of families across latitudes.</p>

<p>Our findings imply that the rhizocentric hypothesis can be a valuable approach to understand fine root trait syndromes and the evolution of absorptive roots in vascular plants.</p> <p>Funding provided by: Agence Nationale de la Recherche<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665<br>Award Number: ANR-13-BSV7-009</p><p>Funding provided by: Agence Nationale de la Recherche<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665<br>Award Number: ANR-10- LABX-25-01</p>","2021-12-26","9,7,8,3,4","location","no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","no","zenodo"

These factors therefore limit large-scale effective management strategies.
Evidence is growing that the quantity of eDNA may be related not only to species presence/absence, but also to species abundance. In this study, the concentrations of environmental DNA (eDNA) from a highly prized sport fish species, Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush (Walbaum 1792), were estimated in water samples from 12 natural lakes and compared to abundance and biomass data obtained from standardized gillnet catches as performed routinely for fisheries management purposes. To reduce environmental variability among lakes, all lakes were sampled in spring, between ice melt and water stratification.
The eDNA concentration did not vary significantly with water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and turbidity, but was significantly positively correlated with relative fish abundance estimated as catch per unit effort (CPUE), whereas the relationship with biomass per unit effort (BPUE) was less pronounced.
The value of eDNA to inform about local aquatic species distribution was further supported by the similarity between the spatial heterogeneity of eDNA distribution and spatial variation in CPUE measured by the gillnet method.
Synthesis and applications. Large-scale empirical evidence of the relationship between the eDNA concentration and species abundance allows for the assessment of the potential to integrate eDNA within fisheries management plans. As such, the eDNA quantitative method represents a promising population abundance assessment tool that could significantly reduce the costs associated with sampling and increase the power of detection, the spatial coverage and the frequency of sampling, without any negative impacts on fish populations. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">eDNA DATA_ALR et al.

In North America, the last ice age is the most recent event with severe consequences on boreal species' ranges. Phylogeographic patterns of range expansion in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) suggested that Beringia is likely to be a refugium and the ""ice-free corridor"" in Alberta may represent a region where small populations persisted during the last glacial maximum (LGM). The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether the origins of trembling aspen in western North America are reflected in the patterns of neutral genetic diversity and population structure. A total of 28 sites were sampled covering the northwestern part of aspen's distribution, from Saskatchewan to Alaska. Twelve microsatellite markers were used to describe patterns of genetic diversity. The genetic structure of trembling aspen populations was assessed by using multivariate analyses, Mantel correlograms, neighbor-joining trees and Bayesian analysis.
Results
Microsatellite markers revealed little to no neutral genetic structure of P. tremuloides populations in northwestern North America. Low differentiation among populations and small isolation by distance (IBD) were observed. The most probable number of clusters detected by STRUCTURE was K = 3 (∆K = 5.9). The individuals in the populations of the 3 clusters share a common gene pool and showed a high level of admixture. No evidence was found that either Beringia or the ""ice-free corridor"" were refugia. Highest allelic richness (AR) and lowest heterozygosity (Ho) were observed in Alberta foothills of the Rocky Mountains.
Conclusions
Contrary to our hypothesis, our results showed that microsatellite markers revealed little to no genetic structure in P. tremuloides populations. Consequently, no divergent populations were observed near supposed refugia. The lack of detectable refugia in Beringia and in the ""ice-free corridor"" was due to high levels of gene flow between trembling apsen populations. More favorable environmental conditions for sexual reproduction and successful trembling aspen seedling establishment may have contributed to increase allelic richness through recombination in populations from the Albertan foothills of the Rocky Mountains. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Aspen_SSR_Data_Latutrie_et _al<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">This excel dataset is composed of 3 pages, one with the geographical coordinates of the sampled sites, and two pages with the data in the STRUCTURE and GenAlex formats.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Donnée_Phylo_chap1.xlsx<br></div></div> Aspen","2016-10-28","3,7,6","location","no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA","NA","NA","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12862-016-0810-1","no","zenodo"

Yet, in temperate forests, bottom-up forces often exert a strong influence on ecosystem functioning. Here, we report on the indirect influence of a pulsed resource, sugar maple (Acer saccharum) seed production, on nest survival in a migratory songbird. We hypothesized that seed production in year t would determine daily nest survival rate in year t + 1 through its effects on seed-eating rodents. We used the density of sugar maple seedlings (with cotyledons) in year t + 1 as a proxy for seed production in year t and predicted that it would be inversely related to songbird nest survival the same year. We estimated the density of sugar maple seedlings, eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) activity, and daily nest survival rate in the ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) over four successive years in a northern hardwood forest of New Brunswick, Canada. Seedling density varied by two orders of magnitude between years, whereas an index of chipmunk activity changed by an order of magnitude. Both variables were positively correlated and negatively correlated to daily nest survival rate. A logistic-exposure model including only seedling density received the greatest level of support (lowest AICc). Previous studies have reported the effect of sugar maple masting on seed-eating rodent populations, but the strong link we report between seedling density and songbird nest survival is novel. A nocturnal seed-eating nest predator, deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), was not considered in our models, which may explain why chipmunk was not the best predictor of daily nest survival rate. The trophic linkages we observed are remarkably strong for a temperate forest ecosystem and might become more prevalent in northeastern North America, at least on calcium-rich soils, with the loss of large-diameter beech trees as a result of beech bark disease. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Data from: Linking songbird nest predation to seedling density: sugar maple masting as a resource pulse in a forest food web<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Nest data were collected in four 25 ha plots from 2012 to 2015.

Using a medium-density SNP array, we documented genomic diversity and divergence at 2336 genetically mapped loci among three pairs of North American anadromous and freshwater Atlantic salmon populations. Our results show that across the genome, freshwater populations have lower diversity and a smaller proportion of private polymorphism relative to anadromous populations. Moreover, differentiation was more pronounced among freshwater than among anadromous populations at multiple spatial scales, suggesting a large effect of genetic drift in these isolated freshwater populations. Using nonhierarchical and hierarchical genome scans, we identified hundreds of markers spread across the genome that are potentially under divergent selection between anadromous and freshwater populations, but few outlier loci were repeatedly found in all three freshwater–anadromous comparisons. Similarly, a sliding window analysis revealed numerous regions of high divergence that were nonparallel among the three comparisons. These last results show little evidence for the parallel evolution of alleles selected for in freshwater populations, but suggest nonparallel adaptive divergence at many loci of small effects distributed through the genome. Overall, this study emphasizes the important role of genetic drift in driving genome-wide reduction in diversity and divergence in freshwater Atlantic salmon populations and suggests a complex multigenic basis of adaptation to resident and anadromous strategies with little parallelism. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">203individuals_2716SNPs<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Contains the genotypes of the 203 Atlantic salmon individuals from Québec, Canada, analysed in this study at 2716 SNPs.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div> Salmo salar Canada; Quebec","2017-09-20","3,6",NA,"yes","M","repository",".txt","not given","not given","Map, geological feature me","Atlantic salmon","not given","not given","not given","not given",NA,"source link abstract","10000","not given","EBV genetic analysis","NA","NA","Molecular Ecology","https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.12500","no","dryad"

The vast majority of animal species display range fidelity, a space-use behaviour enhancing familiarity with local habitat features. While the fitness benefits of this behaviour have been demonstrated in a variety of taxa, some species or populations rather display infidelity, displacing their home range over time. Others, such as many ungulate species, show seasonal adjustments in their range fidelity to accommodate changes in the dominance of limiting factors or in the distribution of resources. 2. Few empirical studies have explored the adaptive value of seasonal adjustments in range fidelity. Using boreal populations of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) as a biological model, we evaluated how range fidelity impacted individual performance during two seasons where juvenile and adult survival are limited by different predation pressures. 3. Between 2004 and 2013, we monitored the survival, reproductive success, habitat selection and range fidelity of female caribou in the boreal forest of eastern Canada. Using resource selection functions, we assessed how seasonal range fidelity was linked to two fitness correlates: calf survival in summer and adult female survival in winter. 4. Females displayed season-specific space use tactics: they selected previously used areas during calving and summer, but tended to shift their winter range from one year to the next. During calving and summer, range fidelity yielded relatively high fitness benefits, as females that did not lose their calf displayed stronger fidelity than females that did. In winter, however, adult survival was negatively linked to range fidelity, as females that survived selected areas further away from their seasonal range of the previous year than females that died. 5. We provide one of the first evidences that making seasonal adjustments in range fidelity can be an adaptive behaviour influencing the spatial distribution of a threatened species. Assessing the seasonal nature of range fidelity tactics may improve our predictions of space use and associated fitness implications for species displaying this behaviour. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">summer_base<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data used in the resource selection function analysis linking habitat selection to range fidelity and calf survival in calving and summer.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">winter_base<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data used in the resource selection function analysis linking habitat selection to range fidelity and adult female survival during winter.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div> site fidelity; familiarity; Caribou; resource selection; spatial memory; calf; Rangifer tarandus caribou; range fidelity; reproductive success Canada; Québec","2018-01-19","3,6",NA,"yes","H","repository",".txt","administrative unit","not given","Map, range coordinates","Rangifer tarandus caribou","2004-2013","2004","2013","source link","9","source link","357644","source publication text","presence-absence","NA","NA","Journal of Animal Ecology","https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12645","no","zenodo"

The strong increase in several arctic geese populations, primarily due to changes in agricultural practices in temperate regions, can have severe direct impacts on tundra ecosystems through vegetation degradation. However, predator-mediated negative effects of goose overabundance on other tundra species can also be significant but are poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that goose abundance negatively affects arctic-nesting shorebirds by increasing nest predation pressure. We used six years of data collected within and near a greater snow goose colony (Chen caerulescens atlantica) to evaluate the effect of geese on the spatial variation in (1) the occurrence of shorebird nest predators, (2) the nest predation risk (with artificial shorebird nests), and (3) the occurrence of nesting shorebirds. We found that the goose colony had a strong influence on the spatial distribution of nest predators and nesting shorebirds. Occurrence of predators decreased, while occurrence of nesting shorebirds increased with distance from the centroid of the colony. The strength of these effects was modulated by lemming density, the preferred prey for predators. Shorebird nest predation risk also decreased with distance from the colony. Overall, these results indicate that goose abundance negatively affects arctic-nesting shorebirds through shared predators. Therefore, we show that the current decline of some arctic shorebird populations may be in part mediated by a negative effect of an overabundant species. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">DATA_MS#ECS16-0660<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Database on the impacts of overabundant Greater Snow Geese on sympatric species, with a focus on shorebirds.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div> Chen caerulescens; Vulpes lagopus; Pluvialis squatarola; Charadrius hiaticula; Larus hyperboreus; Phalaropus fulicarius; Calidris canutus; Stercorarius parasiticus; waders; Calidris fuscicollis; bird colony; Calidris melanotos; Pluvialis dominica; shared enemy; Calidris bairdii; shorebirds; waterfowl; 2010-2015; Corvus corax; Tryngites subruficollis; Arenaria interpres Arctic","2018-03-17","3,5,4,6,10",NA,"yes","H","repository",".xlsx","sample coordinates","not given","Map","40 species (mostly birds and few mammals)","2010-2015","2010","2015","source publication text, dataset","6","source link abstract","65","not given","density","NA","NA","Ecosphere","https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1788","no","zenodo"

Rescue interacts with trophic structure because a physical stress experienced by a focal assemblage within the community may also be experienced by its predators and prey.  In general, trophic structure will facilitate rescue only when a stress has a less severe effect on a focal assemblage than on its predators.  In other circumstances, when stress affects prey or has only a weak effect on predators, trophic structure is likely to hamper rescue.  We exposed a community of phytoplankton and zooplankton derived from a natural lake to acidification in outdoor mesocosms large enough to support trophically complex communities.  Rescue of the phytoplankton from severe acidification was facilitated by prior exposure to sublethal stress, confirming previous results from microcosm experiments.  Even communities that have previously been less highly stressed were eventually rescued, however, probably because their zooplankton predators were more sensitive to acidification and became extinct.  Our experiment shows how community rescue following severe stress is modulated by the differential effect of the stress relative to trophic level. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Data for Bell et al. 2019 Proc B<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Spreadsheet containing the pH, phytoplankton, and zooplankton measurements taken in all mesocosms on all sampling occasions.

Current food web theory considers interactions between numerous species simultaneously, but descriptive models are unable to predict interactions between newly co-occurring species. Incorporating proxies such as functional traits and phylogeny into models could help infer predator/ prey interactions.
Here we used trait-matching between predator feeding traits and prey vulnerability traits, along with phylogeny (used as a proxy for chemical defence and other traits difficult to document), to infer predatory interactions using ground beetles as model organisms.
A feeding experiment was conducted involving 20 ground beetle and 115 prey species to determine which pair of species did or did not interact. Eight predator and four prey functional traits were measured directly on specimens. Then, using a modeling approach based on the matching-centrality formalism, we evaluated 511 predictive ecological models that tested different combinations of all predator and prey functional traits, and phylogenetic information.
The most parsimonious model accurately predicted 81 % of the observed realized and unrealized interactions, using phylogenetic information and the trait-matches predator biting force/ prey cuticular toughness and predator/ prey body size ratio. The best trait-based models predicted correctly &gt;80 % which species interact (realized interactions), but predict &lt;58 % of which species did not interact (unrealized interactions). Adding a phylogenetic term representing the evolutionary distance within each trophic level increased the ability to predict which species did not interact to &gt;75 %.
The matching of predator biting force and prey cuticular toughness demonstrated a better predictive power than the commonly used predator/ prey body size ratio. Our novel model combining both functional traits and phylogeny extends beyond existing descriptive approaches and could represent a valuable tool to predict consumer/ resource interactions of newly introduced species and to resolve cryptic food webs. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Feeding traits of ground beetles (Carabidae)<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Traits and phylogenetic position for each ground beetle individual used in a feeding experiment conducted in a controlled laboratory environment.

It is also available here: . ABSTRACT: The spatial structure of host-parasite coevolution is shaped by population structure and genetic diversity of the interacting species. We analyzed these population genetic parameters in three related ant species: the parasitic slavemaking ant Protomognathus americanus and its two host species Temnothorax longispinosus and T. curvispinosus. We sampled throughout their range, genotyped ants on six to eight microsatellite loci and an MtDNA sequence and found high levels of genetic variation and strong population structure in all three species. Interestingly, the most abundant species and primary host, T. longispinosus, is characterized by less structure, but lower local genetic diversity. Generally, differences between the species were small, and we conclude that they have similar evolutionary potentials. The coevolutionary interaction between this social parasite and its hosts may therefore be less influenced by divergent evolutionary potentials, but rather by varying selection pressures. We employed different methods to quantify and compare genetic diversity and structure between species and genetic markers. We found that Jost D is well suited for these comparisons, as long as mutation rates between markers and species are similar. If this is not the case, for example, when using MtDNA and microsatellites to study sex-specific dispersal, model-based inference should be used instead of descriptive statistics (such as D or GST). Using coalescent-based methods, we indeed found that males disperse much more than females, but this sex bias in dispersal differed between species. The findings of the different approaches with regard to genetic diversity and structure were in good accordance with each other. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">P.americanusGenepop<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">For each species there are three files, one with the geographic distances and one with the microsatellite data in Genepop format and one with the MtDNA sequences.

Although the disease is more severe on spruce and pine trees, this pathogen can infect several coniferous species. In order to study the population structure of O. tomentosa, we harvested 180 basidiocarps in a 45-year-old white spruce plantation in western Quebec in autumn 1997, and extracted DNA directly from individual basidiocarps. Using a combination of spatial coordinates and molecular data based on the analysis of two mitochondrial and three nuclear loci, we measured the average genet size and molecular diversity and assessed the relative contribution of basidiospores and vegetative growth to the stand colonization. Most of the sampled basidiocarps that clustered spatially belonged to the same genet. A total of thirty-seven discrete multilocus genets of an average size of 3.42 m were obtained. The genet size distribution was skewed toward smaller genets (&lt; 3 m) that displayed higher diversity than the larger genets (&gt; 3 m). The nuclear loci were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the larger genets, but not in the smaller genets, which displayed a deficiency of heterozygotes. This suggests a Wahlund effect, whereby different colonization events resulted in expected heterozygosity higher than observed heterozygosity. Using an estimate of the growth rate of the fungus, only a few of the largest genets were approximately the age of the plantation. These observations are consistent with the colonization by basidiospores subsequent to site preparation and tree planting followed by secondary colonization events and vegetative spread. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">CLones_3_MJB<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Multilocus Genotypes of fungus, with size of clones in bins of 3 m</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">IT_Act_MJB<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Phylip file of Actin gene sequence.

We used a combination of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), nuclear microsatellites and spatial distribution modelling to study the population genetic structure of the boreal chickadee (Poecile hudsonicus), a resident passerine, and to investigate whether historical or contemporary barriers have influenced this northern species. MtDNA data showed evidence of eastern and western groups, with secondary admixture occurring in central Canada. This suggests that the boreal chickadee probably persisted in multiple glacial refugia, one in Beringia and at least one in the east. Palaeo-distribution modelling identified suitable habitat in Beringia (Alaska), Atlantic Canada and the southern United States, and correspond to divergence dates of 60–96 kya. Pairwise FST values for both mtDNA and microsatellites were significant for all comparisons involving Newfoundland, though mtDNA data suggest a more recent separation. Furthermore, unlike mtDNA data, nuclear data support population connectivity among the continental populations, possibly due to male-biased dispersal. Although both are significant, the isolation-by-distance signal is much stronger for mtDNA (r2=0.51) than for microsatellites (r2=0.05), supporting the hypothesis of male-biased dispersal. The population structure of the boreal chickadee was influenced by isolation in multiple refugia and contemporary barriers. In addition to geographical distance, physical barriers such as the Strait of Belle Isle and northern mountains in Alaska are restricting gene flow, whereas the Rocky Mountains in the west are a porous barrier. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Microsatellite raw data of 6 loci for boreal chickadees across North America<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">The file contains the raw sizes for six microsatellite loci.

Mass-flowering crops are only in bloom for a few weeks and unable to support bee populations that persist throughout the year. Farm fields and orchards that flower in succession potentially can extend the availability of floral resources for pollinators. However, it is unclear whether the same bee species or genera will forage from one crop to the next, which bees specialize on particular crops, and to what degree inter-crop visitation patterns will be mediated by landscape context. We therefore studied local- and landscape-level drivers of bee diversity and species turnover in apple orchards, blueberry fields and raspberry fields that bloom sequentially in southern Quebec, Canada. Despite the presence of high bee species turnover, orchards and small fruit fields complemented each other phenologically by supporting two bee genera essential to their pollination: mining bees (Andrena spp.) and bumble bees (Bombus spp.). A number of bee species specialized on apple, blueberry or raspberry blossoms, suggesting that all three crops could be used to promote regional bee diversity. Bee diversity (rarefied richness, wild bee abundance) was highest across crops in landscapes containing hedgerows, meadows and suburban areas that provide ancillary nesting and floral resources throughout the spring and summer. Promoting phenological complementarity in floral resources at the farmstead and landscape scales is essential to sustaining diverse wild bee populations. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Bee community, environmental and landscape variables<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Please refer to associated READ_ME file.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Martins_et_al_2018_data_files.zip<br></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div> Andrena barbilabris; Agapostemon texanus; Hylaeus annulatus; Hylaeus affinis; Bombus rufocinctus; Apidae; Colletes inaequalis; landscape ecology; Andrena cressonii; Andrena commoda; Andrena wilkella; Halictus rubicundus; Andrena milwaukeensis; Osmia pumila; Ceratina mikmaqi; complementarity; Andrena hippotes; Lasioglossum versans; Andrena nivalis; Andrena regularis; Andrena imitatrix; Andrena miserabilis; raspberry; blueberry; Lasioglossum zonulum; Bombus bimaculatus; Andrena miranda; Hoplitis producta; Lasioglossum cinctipes; Andrena bisalicis; Hylaeus modestus; Hylaeus mesillae; Augochlorella aurata; Heriades carinata; Andrena carlini; Andrena nasonii; Halictus confusus; Andrena perplexa; Hoplitis spoliata; Andrena w-scripta; Lasioglossum laevissimum; Lasioglossum smilacinae; Ceratina dupla; Andrena vicina; Lasioglossum pilosum; Lasioglossum foxii; Lasioglossum cressonii; Osmia atriventris; Lasioglossum quebecense; Bombus perplexus; wild pollinators; Lasioglossum sagax; Andrena forbesii; Ceratina calcarata; Andrena wheeleri; Lasioglossum nigroviride; Holcopasites calliopsidis; Andrena carolina; Andrena duningii; Andrena rugosa; Andrena rufosignata; Andrena bradleyi; Lasioglossum coriaceum; Andrena erythronii; Andrena thaspii; Hoplitis pilosifrons; Agapostemon virescens; Bombus vagans; Bombus griseocollis; Bombus borealis; Lasioglossum ephialtum; Lasioglossum lineatulum; Andrena crataegi; Lasioglossum coeruleum; apple; Osmia proxima; Bombus ternarius; Augochlora pura; Sphecodes davisii Montérégie; Québec","2018-02-20","3,4,6",NA,"yes","M","repository",".csv","site coordinates","not given","Map, administrative unit","bee communities","2012","2012","2012","not given","<1","not given","3000","not given","abundance, other","NA","NA","Ecological Applications","https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.1713","no","dryad"

We conducted this study in 92 plots of the Trait-Based experiment (3.5 m x 3.5 m size), comprehending the two species pools, with a gradient of plant species richness of 1 to 8 species. We performed a non-destructive measurement of plant community canopy structure at high resolution, we used a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) Faro Focus 3D X330 (FARO Technologies Inc., 2011). We scanned 92 plots on April 31st (the first peak of biomass) and August 20th, 2014 (the second biomass peak). The TLS was mounted upside-down on a tripod that was elevated 3.35 m above ground level. The legs of the tripod were centered on permanent survey markers to guarantee identical scanning areas on both dates. We extracted an area of 3.75 m² (1.5 m x 2.5 m) in each plot below the scanner to reduce the effect of shadows within scans. The point clouds of the 92 plots were filtered using statistical outlier removal (SOR) and noise filter. We used the 3D point clouds from terrestrial laser scanning to calculate metrics characterizing vertical and horizontal dimensions of the community canopy structure. We produced height-based metrics from the point cloud of each community. We used mean height as the first vertical dimension metric. To characterize vertical space-filling properties, we calculated the evenness and the center of gravity of the point cloud. Evenness reports the homogeneity of the point cloud density in their vertical distribution, while the center of gravity identifies the height stratum (definition see below) with the highest density of points (Spehn et al., 2000; Barry et al., 2020). As a baseline for only these two vertical metrics (evenness and center of gravity), we calculated voxel grids from the 3D point cloud for each plot. For each scan, a voxel grid of 5 cm was created containing at least one laser return, and the volume was then calculated as the product of the cell area and the attributed height. We used the function 'vox' from the R package VoxR (Lecigne et al., 2014). We used the voxel grids to define five different strata of height (0.3 - 20 cm, 20 - 40 cm, 40 - 60 cm, 60 – 80 cm, and 80 - 100 cm). For every stratum, we applied the method 'Sum of Voxel,' which calculated the sum of all voxels separately for each of the five strata. As a result, we obtained volumetric data based on 3D point clouds for five different strata and the community canopy height. Based on this information, the evenness metric represents the mean proportion of filled voxels across strata of vegetation height, calculated as the sum of all five voxel strata volumes divided by 5. The center of gravity, in turn, used the volume of voxel grids per height strata to identify the location with the highest density of points. This location was measured in terms of the height-weighted average volume allocation of the community. We then calculated the center of gravity by multiplying each stratum's volume with the mean height of the strata and dividing by the total community volume. Center of gravity range from 1 to 5, in which 1 is the bottom layer (0-20 cm) and five the top canopy (80-100 cm). Further, the leaf area index was also measured at the same time in all 92 plots using the LAI-2000 plant canopy analyzer (LI-Cor, Inc, 2013). Ten random measurements were averaged to a mean of LAI value per plot. Hence, we used LAI as an additional vertical dimensional metric to characterize plant ground area covered by the plant community. To assess the horizontal heterogeneity of the plant community for each plot, we also calculated two horizontal metrics describing the canopy surface variation and clumpiness. We used the surface reconstruction method, which fits a mesh on the 3D point cloud density of each plot (the filtered point clouds and not voxel grids) (Attene &amp; Spagnuolo, 2000). We applied the Poisson Surface Reconstruction method, which fits a mesh on all oriented points (perpendicular vectors to the tangential plane to the surface at that point) (Kazhdan &amp; Hoppe, 2019). After producing the surface mesh for all plots, a surface area of the mesh in square meters was calculated and divided by the area of the plot (3.75 m²). The variation metric is a dimensionless ratio between the mesh surface area and the ground area. For clumpiness, we evaluated the size and distribution of clusters in the spatial arrangement of the point cloud into two dimensions based on the rasterized 3D point clouds. For this, we computed Geary´s index, an identifier of cluster points with similar attributes, assessed by the pixel spatial autocorrelation. We used the function Geary from the R package ""raster"". The two response variables, the mean and the coefficient of variation (hereafter CV) of community surface temperature were obtained using the Testo 882 Thermal Imaging Camera, which also recorded RGB images of all 92 plots (for example, Figure 3). We obtained the thermal data and terrestrial laser scans within two days. All thermal measurements were carried out around noon (12:30 – 13:30), at 150 cm height, and facing north. The thermal camera settings controlled the canopy's emissivity as 0.95 with reflectance temperature at 20°C. The sensor detects long-wave infrared radiation in the spectral range from 7.5 to 14 μm and has a thermal sensitivity of 50 mK at +30°C and accuracy of ±2.0°C. With the thermal matrix (registered pixel temperature with an original resolution of 640 x 480), we computed the mean and the coefficient of variation of surface temperature for each plot. As flower heads are often 10 K warmer than the surrounding leaves of herbs and grasses, we calculated the Normalized Green-Red Difference Index (NGRDI, the difference between the green and red bands divided by their sum (Pérez et al., 2000). Further, we also calculated the Normalized Green-Blue Difference Index (NGBDI, the difference between the green and the blue bands divided by their sum (Wang Xiaoqin et al., 2015) better to distinguish the hot spots of inflorescences and green vegetation. We expected that biodiversity effects on mean canopy surface temperature are indirectly mediated by predictors related to vertical structure metrics, while biodiversity effects on temperature CV are mediated by the horizontal structure. To test these assumptions further, we constructed a more detailed formal hypothesis using linear mixed-effects models within a PiecewiseSEM (Lefcheck, 2016). we ran the initial SEM model as a list of causal relationships between canopy structure and biodiversity facets. The last linear model inside the SEM was between the mean and CV of surface temperature and biodiversity facets (functional identity, dispersion, and species richness) and all canopy structure metrics to test the fit of the model to the data. Second, we inspected this initial SEM model results for goodness-of-fit tests for both the full and causal relationships, we then added the predictors that significantly improved the model fit with P values higher than 0.05.</span></span></p> <ol>

<a name=""_Hlk61288143""> Canopy structure is an important driver of the energy budget of the grassland ecosystem and is, at the same time, altered by plant diversity. </a>Diverse plant communities typically have taller and more densely packed canopies than less diverse communities. With this, they absorb more radiation, have a higher transpiring leaf surface, and are better coupled to the atmosphere which leads to cooler canopy surfaces. However, whether plant diversity generally translates into a cooling potential remains unclear and lacks empirical evidence. Here, we assessed how functional identity, functional diversity, and species richness of grassland communities in the Jena Experiment predict the mean and variation of plant surface temperature mediated via effects of canopy structure.</li>
	<li>Using terrestrial laser scanning, we estimated canopy structure describing metrics of vertical structure (mean height, LAI), the distribution (evenness), and the highest allocation (center of gravity) of biomass along height strata. As metrics of horizontal structure, we considered community stands gaps, canopy surface variation, and emergent flowers. We measured surface temperature with a thermal camera. We used SEM models to predict biodiversity effects on the surface temperature during two seasonal peaks of biomass.</li>
	<li>Before the first cut in May, herb-dominated communities directly promoted lower leaf surface temperatures. However, communities with a lower center of gravity (mostly herb-dominated) also increased canopy surface temperatures compared with grass-dominated communities with higher biomass stored in the top canopy. Grass-dominated communities showed a smaller variation of surface temperatures, which was also positively affected by species richness via an increase in mean height. In August, mean surface temperature decreased with increasing community clumpiness and LAI. The variation of surface temperature was greater in herb-dominated than in grass-dominated communities and increased with plant species richness (direct effects).</li>
	<li>Synthesis: The mean and variation of canopy surface temperature were driven by differences in functional group composition (herbs- vs. grass dominance) and to a lesser extent by plant diversity. These effects were partly mediated by the metrics of canopy structure but also by direct effects unrelated to the structural metrics considered.  </li>

In birds, phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature is thought to be the main mechanism underlying yearly adjustment in the timing of breeding. However, other factors could be important and interact to affect the levels of plastic responses between and/or within-individuals. Here we use long-term individual-based data on Tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) to identify the spatial and environmental drivers affecting plasticity in laying date and to assess their importance at both population and individual levels. We found that laying date has advanced by 4.2 days over 10 years, and that it was mainly influenced by latitude and an interaction between spring temperature and breeder density. Analyses of individual plasticity showed that increases in temperature, but not in breeder density, resulted in within-individual advances in laying date. Our results suggest that females can adjust their laying date as a function of temperature, but that this adjustment will be partly constrained in habitats with lower breeder densities. Such potential constraint is especially worrying for the broad array of species already declining as a result of climate change. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Data: determinants of laying date at the population level<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data used for the analysis of the determinants of laying date at the population level, where each line represented a farm within a year.

Each plot was composed of 50 nest-boxes placed in a regular grid, covering an area of approximately 9-12 ha. Nest-boxes were monitored throughout the breeding season (April-July) at least once per week to record lay date (back-calculated assuming one egg was laid per day), clutch size, onset of incubation, hatching and fledging date, and the number of fledglings. Breeders were caught in the nest-box using spring traps, and banded with a metal band if not previously banded, when their nestlings were 7-12 days old. We thus were able to determine whether, within a breeding season, pairs initiated a second clutch, and whether it was a replacement or a true second clutch. A replacement clutch is here defined as a clutch initiated after the failure of the pair (identified by bands) to produce fledglings from their first brood within the focal year. Since we could not identify individuals that failed prior to capture, we had to exclude nests that failed before hatching (n = 241 nests), or when nestlings were less than 7 days old (n = 135 nests).</span></span></p> In various taxa, multibroodedness is a common breeding strategy. Life-history theory predicts that individuals can increase fitness by producing multiple broods within a season. Despite the apparent increase in the number of offspring parents might produce per season, not all individuals are multibrooded, suggesting a trade-off. We studied ecological and behavioral factors influencing the initiation of second clutches in great tits (Parus major), an optionally multibrooded bird species, by distinguishing two types of clutches: replacement vs. true second clutches, produced after failure vs. successful first breeding attempts, respectively. We predicted that lay date, density, and investment in first clutches would decrease the probability of initiating a second clutch, but that faster exploring behavioral types with a faster pace-of-life would be more likely to be multibrooded. The probability of initiating true second clutches varied negatively within-individuals with lay date and breeding density. The initiation of replacement clutches instead varied negatively among-individuals with lay date and density, suggesting non-random settlement of behavioral types across environments. Individuals were less likely to be multibrooded when producing many offspring from their first clutch, suggesting within-year reproductive trade-offs, similar to previous studies. No previous research has linked personality to multibroodedness; here we show that neither the repeatable nor the plastic part of an individual's exploratory behavior predicted multibroodedness. We confirmed our prediction that the resolution of trade-offs may occur either at the within- or among-individual level. Our research contributes to the understanding of life-history evolution in the wild by studying the mechanisms shaping multibroodedness within seasons.    --  Individual plasticity; Life-history trade-offs; multibroodedness; multi-level variation; pace-of-life; Life-history trade-offs; multibroodedness; multi-level variation; pace-of-life; Life-history trade-offs; multibroodedness; multi-level variation; pace-of-life","2021-06-30","3,10","location","no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","no",NA

The main observation point is situated 55 m above sea level, on sand dunes surrounded by boreal forest and adjacent to the estuary of the St. Lawrence River. Due to the microhabitat of the dunes being unfavourable for breeding birds, the area is visited mostly by migrating birds passing through. The funnel effect created by the estuary, where birds migrating south follow the shoreline, creates a high density of migrants passing through the region (Ibarzabal 1999), The open habitat of the dunes, cleared from vegetation every year, facilitates detection for observers. Stationary observations were carried out daily by at least one experienced birdwatcher from August 24 to November 25 in each year. The observations started approximately one hour after sunrise and lasted five hours or more depending on the migration flow. Only heavy rain or snow prematurely ended the observations</p> <p>The phenology of migrating birds is shifting with climate change. For instance, short-distance migrants wintering in temperate regions tend to delay their migration in fall<br>
during spells of warmer temperature. However, some species do not show strong shifts, and the factors determining which species will react to temperature changes by delaying their migration are poorly known. In addition, it is not known whether a slower migration or a postponed departure creates the observed delays in fall migration because most studies occur far south of the boreal breeding areas making it difficult to separate those two mechanisms. We used 22 years of data at a northern observatory in eastern North America, at the southern edge of the boreal forest, to examine how 21 short-distance migrants responded to changing temperatures. We investigated if those species responding to temperature share life history features (i.e. diet, size, total migration distance, breeding habitat, timing of migration). The period of migration in each species was, by far, the most important factor predicting the response of a species to temperature. Eight of the 13 species migrating in October changed their migration onset with temperature (usually by delaying migration by 1-2d/°C), while the migration timing of none of the eight species migrating in September was dependent on temperature. Furthermore, the absence of a greater migration delay by birds breeding farther from the study site (i.e. Arctic breeding birds) suggests the mechanism is a postponed departure rather than a slower migration. We conclude that temperature variations in late fall influence the conditions on the breeding grounds, so that birds still present at that time might benefit more from postponing their departure in warm weather.</p> <p>Funding provided by: Environment and Climate Change Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008638<br>Award Number: </p><p>Funding provided by: Ministère des Forêts, de la Faune et des Parcs<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011219<br>Award Number: </p>","2020-10-29","3,7",NA,"yes","H","repository",".xlsx","site IDs","site coordinates","Map, site coordinates","21 bird species","1996-2017","1996","2017","source link","22","source link abstract","not given","NA","abundance","NA","NA","Ornithology","NA","no","zenodo"

<p style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">We selected three characteristic habitats in The Netherlands in which ragwort plants and cinnabar moths occur in their native range: coastal dunes (Meijendel), inland natural grasslands (Veluwe) and riverine grasslands (Wageningen) and sampled in three localities within each habitat. At each locality, ten <i>Jacobaeae vulgaris </i>plants on which <i>Tyria jacobaeae</i> caterpillars were feeding were selected (<span>SI Figure S1</span>). Plants were located at a distance of at least 10 m to each other (except for two sampling localities in riverine grasslands where the smallest distance between two plants was 8.3 and 9.2 m). Around the stem of each plant, five soil samples from the top 5 cm layer were taken using a 20 cm soil borer with 2 cm diameter and pooled together. Caterpillars collected from each individual plant were kept together (with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 10 caterpillars collected per plant). All samples were stored in a cooler with ice until processing in the laboratory on the same day. Fresh weight of each individual caterpillar was recorded (<span>SI Figure S2</span>; <span>SI Table S1</span>). All caterpillars were surface sterilized by dipping them for 30 seconds in the following solutions: 70% ethanol, 2.0% bleach, and then rinsed twice with autoclaved demineralized water. Caterpillars were surface sterilized to enrich the samples for gut rather than surface microbes while leaving gut microbes intact [20]. Both caterpillar and soil samples were stored at -20 °C until further processing. Caterpillar samples were lyophilized prior to DNA extractions. </p>

<h3 style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">DNA extraction and library preparation</h3>

<p style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">To obtain a representative sample of caterpillars feeding on one plant, DNA was extracted collectively from three homogenized caterpillars, from approximately 10 mg of dry, lyophilized sample. In total, 270 caterpillars were used in this study (9 study locations x 10 plants x 3 caterpillars per sample). Extractions were performed using the MP Biomedicals FastDNA™ Spin Kit (MP Biomedicals, Solon, Ohio, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol with the following modifications. Samples homogenized with Cell Lysis Solution in the FastPrep® Instrument (MP Biomedicals) for 20 seconds (speed setting of 6.0) were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. An extra washing step was included, and the final eluted DNA was additionally precipitated prior further purification using standard ethanol precipitation method with potassium acetate.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">From approximately 0.35 g of soil samples, DNA was extracted from 90 samples using DNeasy PowerSoil Kit DNA (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's protocol.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">Approximately 10 ng of template DNA was used for PCR using primers 515FB [21] and 806RB [22] targeting the V4 habitat of the 16S rRNA gene [23]. The PCR mixture (25 µl) contained 12.5 µl Phusion Flash High Fidelity PCR Master Mix (Thermo Scientific), 1.25 µl of each of the primers (10 µM). The conditions were 45 s at 98 °C, followed by 30 cycles for caterpillars and 25 for soil samples of 98 °C for 5 s, 55 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 10 s with a final extension of 1 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Adapters and barcodes were added to samples using Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit sets A-B (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The final PCR product was purified again with AMPure beads, verified using agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Hudson, NH, USA) before equimolar pooling. Separate libraries were prepared for bacterial communities derived from caterpillar and soil samples (96 samples per library) including extraction negatives. Libraries were sequenced at McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Center.</p>

<h3 style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">Sequence processing</h3>

<p style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">Raw reads were processed into ASVs (amplicon sequence variants) using the DADA2 pipeline [24], and taxonomic identification was performed by querying against the SILVA database with SINA classifier [25]. Reads that could not be assigned to Bacteria (i.e. Archaea, Eukaryotes, mitochondria, chloroplast, and unidentified) and all the bacterial ASVs present in the extraction negatives were excluded. The percentage of mitochondria and chloroplast reads was variable between samples, as it is often reported in insect gut microbiome studies [26], but did not significantly differ between localities or regions (SI Figure S2). Caterpillar and soil datasets were filtered separately due to their inherent differences in bacterial diversity. Only samples with sequencing depth ranging from five times more to five times less than the mean sequencing depth of caterpillar or soil samples were kept for further analysis. To explore general patterns of bacterial diversity among samples, the caterpillar and soil datasets were resampled to the lowest sequencing depth of 3,849 and 13,731 reads, respectively. This resulted in removing three caterpillar samples (one from each habitat); while all soil samples were kept. The combined rarefied datasets resulted in 1,570,653 reads assigned to 41,089 bacterial ASVs, of which 11,685 ASVs were present in high abundance (&gt;0.1% relative abundance).</p>

<h3 style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">Microbiome analysis</h3>

<p style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">Alpha diversity for caterpillar and soil was assessed on the rarefied datasets by calculating the estimated species richness, Shannon diversity (the exponential of Shannon entropy), and Simpson diversity (the inverse Simpson concentration) [27], using the <i>iNEXT</i> R package [28]. These indices are based on sample-size interpolation and extrapolation sampling curves [29], and represent the diversity estimates for rarefied and extrapolated samples with respect to the number of samples within localities. The estimated diversity was compared between habitats using the nonparametric Wilcoxon test with pairwise adjusted (Holm) p-values. Because caterpillars in the natural populations varied in size (see <span>SI Table S1 and Figure S</span>3 for average weights), to assess potential associations between the fresh biomass of caterpillars and their microbial species diversity or community composition, we used the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, and multivariate GLMs (see method description below), respectively. Moreover, to test whether spatial distribution of the sampled localities had an effect on the structure of bacterial communities in caterpillars, we computed a Mantel test correlation between the distance among localities in kilometers, calculated with the <i>geosphere</i> R package [30] on the geographic coordinates, and the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix bacterial composition of caterpillars. The rarefied relative abundance data were squared-root transformed and Wisconsin double-standardized before the calculation of the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix using the <i>vegan</i> R package [31]. This standardization scales the variability of different samples to each other.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">To display differences in microbiome composition of caterpillar and soil samples among localities within the three habitats, we generated Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) ordination plots using the <i>ape</i> R package [32], using the squared-root transformed and Wisconsin double-standardized data. To reduce the influence of taxa present in few samples to the overall community composition, only ASVs present in at least three caterpillar or soil samples with a relative abundance higher than 0.1% in each dataset were included in the PCoA. The homogeneity of dispersion of the microbiome data was tested using <i>betadisper</i> function in <i>vegan</i> R package, and for both caterpillars and soil in the nine localities within the three habitats, data were overdispersed. We recognize that distance-based approaches can perform poorly when the data presents strong mean-variance relationships [33], therefore we used it only as a means to visualize differences in microbiomes.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">To assess caterpillar and soil microbiome community differences between localities and within habitats, we used a multivariate model-based approach [34], using the <i>mvabund</i> R package [35]. The microbiome structure of caterpillars or soil within locations or habitats was tested in separate models. We used a GLM with negative binomial distribution and a log-link function to account for the overdispersion of the data. In the multivariate GLM, a model was fit to each ASV and the log-likelihood ratio (LR) of each model was summed to create an overall sum-of-LR [34]. Examination of the residual plots from the models showed no clear patterns indicating that the negative binomial GLM model was appropriate. Significance of the models was evaluated using 999 resampling iterations with PIT-trap resampling [36]. In addition, a linear discriminant analysis coupled with effect size measurements (LEfSe) based on Wilcoxon sum-rank test [37] was used to screen for differentially abundant bacteria at any taxonomic level among the three habitats.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;""> </p> <p><b>Background</b>: Insect-associated microorganisms can provide a wide range of benefits to their host, but insect dependency on these microbes varies greatly. The origin and functionality of insect microbiomes is not well understood. Many caterpillars can harbor symbionts in their gut that impact host metabolism, nutrient uptake and pathogen protection. Despite our lack of knowledge on the ecological factors driving microbiome assemblages of wild caterpillars, they seem to be highly variable and influenced by diet and environment. Several recent studies have shown that shoot-feeding caterpillars acquire part of their microbiome from the soil. Here, we examine microbiomes of a monophagous caterpillar (<i>Tyria jacobaeae</i>) collected from its natural host plant (<i>Jacobaeae vulgaris</i>) growing in three different environments: coastal dunes, natural inland grasslands and riverine grasslands, and compare the bacterial communities of the wild caterpillars to those of soil samples collected from underneath each of the host plants from which the caterpillars were collected.</p>

<p><b>Results</b>: The microbiomes of the caterpillars were dominated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Only 5% of the total bacterial diversity represented 86.2% of the total caterpillar's microbiome. Interestingly, we found a high consistency of dominant bacteria within the family Burkholderiaceae in all caterpillar samples across the three habitats. There was one amplicon sequence variant belonging to the genus <i>Ralstonia</i> that represented on average 53% of total community composition across all caterpillars. On average, one quarter of the caterpillar microbiome was shared with the soil.</p>

<p><b>Conclusions</b>: We found that the monophagous caterpillars collected from fields located more than 100 kilometers apart were all dominated by a single <i>Ralstonia</i>. The remainder of the bacterial communities that were present resembled the local microbial communities in the soil in which the host plant was growing.

A total of 180 ponds were sampled during the breeding season in 2017 and 2018 with eDNA, whereas a subset of these ponds were also sampled with call surveys.</p> <p>The boreal chorus frog (<em>Pseudacris maculata</em>) is at risk of extinction in parts of its range in Canada. Our objectives were to quantify the influence of local and landscape characteristics on the occurrence of the species in wetlands in southern Québec. We hypothesized that site occupancy depends on local characteristics and landscape characteristics contributing to site connectivity. We developed an environmental DNA (eDNA) method to detect the species and compared the detection probability of this method to traditional call surveys. We collected water samples at a total of 180 sites (90 in 2017, 110 in 2018), whereas we surveyed a subset of 63 sites using both eDNA and call surveys in 2018. Site occupancy varied across years, but was higher in sites where the species had been previously detected during the last 12 years by other studies. Site occupancy did not vary with other local and landscape characteristics, in part due to an apparent decrease in the number of sites occupied by the species since the last 12 years. Detection probability via eDNA (0.81; 95% CI: [0.31; 0.98]) did not differ from that of call surveys (0.62; 95% CI: [0.25; 0.89]). To identify the optimal sampling period for the boreal chorus frog, future studies should estimate the detection probability of eDNA during the breeding season and the larval development period of the species.</p> <p>The values presented in the data set are the original variables.

Intraspecific phenotypic variation contributing to the persistence of peripheral populations is expected to become increasingly important under future climate conditions in order to avoid local extirpation where range shifts lag behind climate change velocity.</p>
<p>We investigated the putative role of intraspecific phenotypic variation for the maintenance of rear-edge populations of fire-prone jack pine (<em>Pinus banksiana</em>), an obligate pyriscent boreal species. We assessed whether variation in cone serotiny is associated with the population trajectory of marginal stands located south of the boreal biome, in the temperate forest where natural wildfires are infrequent and unpredictable. To this end, we estimated stand-scale serotiny, minimal age and tree size structure in 26 jack pine stands from the rear edge (n = 17 sites) and the core (n = 9 sites) of the species' range in eastern Canada.</p>
<p>On average, rear-edge jack pine populations are less serotinous albeit more variably compared to range-core populations where serotiny is more uniformly high. Rear-edge stands are generally older and display reverse J-shape tree size structure indicative of a multi-aged demographic equilibrium, whereas range-core stands are younger and show a unimodal stand structure depicting a single aging cohort generally lacking interfire recruitment. Eco-evolutionary dynamics shifts from a dependency on wildfires in range-core populations to stands that can regenerate and persist without recurrent fires at the rear edge, where stand-scale serotiny reaches values below 85%.</p>
<p>Synthesis: Unlike range-core populations, rear-edge jack pine populations can locally rely on a dual life-history strategy to ensure both steady recruitment during fire-free intervals and successful postfire regeneration. This capacity to cope with infrequent and unpredictable fire regime should increase the resilience and resistance of jack pine populations as global changes alter fire dynamics of the boreal forest. More generally, unique intraspecific phenotypic variation in rear-edge populations contributes to long-term species persistence in marginal environmental conditions that might scale up with global changes. The conservation of rear-edge populations and their genetic legacy appears crucial for the resilience of species.</p> <p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: RGPIN-2018-06586</p><p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: DGECR-2018-00066</p><p>Funding provided by: Fonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et technologies<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003151<br>Award Number: 2021-NC-286562</p><p>Funding provided by: Canada Research Chairs<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804<br>Award Number: CRC-2017-00112</p> bet-hedging;; eco-evolutionary dynamics; fire regime; local adaptation; rear edge; Pinus banksiana; Demographic trajectories; cone serotiny; Intraspecific trait variability","2022-11-22","3,7,6",NA,"yes","M","repository",".xlsx","site coordinates","not given","Map","10 tree species","2019","2019","2019","source publication text","1","dataset","50000","not given","abundance","NA","NA","Journal of Ecology","NA","no","zenodo"

Plant resistance is the most effective management tool, but it requires a close monitoring of population genetics. Current technologies for pathotyping and genotyping cyst nematodes are time-consuming, expensive and imprecise. In this study, we capitalized on the reproduction mode of cyst nematodes to develop a simple population genetic analysis pipeline based on genotyping-by-sequencing and Pool-Seq. This method yielded thousands of SNPs and allowed us to study the relationships between populations of different origins or pathotypes. Validation of the method on well-characterized populations also demonstrated that it was a powerful and accurate tool for population genetics. The genomewide allele frequencies of 23 populations of golden nematode, from nine countries and representing the five known pathotypes, were compared. A clear separation of the pathotypes and fine genetic relationships between and among global populations were obtained using this method. In addition to being powerful, this tool has proven to be very time- and cost-efficient and could be applied to other cyst nematode species. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Sample description<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Details about the origin (Country, province and field) of the samples, which experiment and figures they were used in and accession numbers (bioproject and biosample numbers).</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Detail on samples.xlsx<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Supplemental Table 1<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Population differentiation (Fst) of 23 worldwide populations of Globodera rostochiensis estimated from genome-wide allele frequencies at 604 loci.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Suppl Table1.docx<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Custom scripts and softwares<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">A link where all the custom scripts and softwares used in this paper can be found.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">scripts.txt<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">PstI-MspI SNP table - UNEAK - 23 worldwide populations<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Generated with mnC=0.8, minCov=1  and a MAF=0.01.

Arctic fox GPS data are available through the Movebank Data Repository at Berteaux, D. 2020, Arctic fox Bylot-GPS tracking, Movebank Study ID 1241071371.</p> Prey handling processes are considered a dominant mechanism leading to short-term positive indirect effects between prey that share a predator. However, a growing body of research indicates that predators  are not necessarily limited by such processes in the wild. Density-dependent changes in predator foraging behavior can also generate positive indirect effects but they are rarely included as explicit functions of prey densities in functional response models. With the aim of untangling proximate mechanisms of species interactions in natural communities and improving our ability to quantify interaction strength, we extended the multi-prey version of the Holling disk equation by including density-dependent changes in predator foraging behavior. Our model, based on species traits and behavior, was inspired by the vertebrate community of the arctic tundra, where the main predator (the arctic fox) is an active forager feeding primarily on cyclic small rodent (lemming) and eggs of various tundra-nesting bird species. Short-term positive indirect effects of lemmings on birds have been documented over the circumpolar Arctic but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We used a unique data set, containing high-frequency GPS tracking, accelerometer, behavioral, and experimental data to parameterize the multi-prey model, and a 15-year time series of prey densities and bird nesting success to evaluate interaction strength between species. We found that: (i) prey handling processes play a minor role in our system and (ii) changes in arctic fox daily activity budget and distance traveled can partly explain the predation release on birds observed during lemming peaks. These adjustments in predator foraging behavior with respect to the main prey density thus appear as the dominant mechanism leading to positive indirect effects commonly reported among arctic tundra prey. Density-dependent changes in functional response components have been little studied in natural vertebrate communities and deserve more attention to improve our ability to quantify the strength of species interactions. <div class=""t-landing__text-wall "">

LA was the total leaf area divided by leaf number, and SLA was the ratio of the total leaf area to oven-dried mass (oven-dried at 70 ºC for 48 h to a constant mass). The soil column was immersed in water for 24 h and then carefully washed to obtain the roots of co-occurring species. On the basis of root color, texture and the connection with its shoots, we identified and separated the plant individual-specific root systems for each species.  Following the steps described in Pregitzer (2002), the whole root systems were completely classified into three orders (the most distal roots represent the first-order roots) for all species occurring in grazing plots (Cheng et al. 2015). After classification, first-, second- and third-order roots of plant individual were scanned separately by using the Epson Perfection V750 Pro (SEIKO EPSON, Nagano, Japan) with the resolution of 300 dpi. The roots were dried and weighted separately after scanning, and the root images were analysed by WinRHIZO Pro 2019 software (Regent Instruments, Quebec, Canada) to obtain root traits including root length, ARD, and volume for each root order. SRL was calculated as the total root length divided by the root dry mass, and RTD was calculated as the root dry mass divided by the root volume.

	<li>Although grazing has significant impacts on plant functional traits and community composition in grasslands, few studies have simultaneously explored how plant above- and below-ground traits and community functional composition respond to grazing.</li>
	<li>Using a grazing manipulation experiment with seven levels of grazing intensity (0, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6.0, 7.5, and 9 sheep ha<sup>-1</sup>) in the Inner Mongolia grassland, we partitioned the roles of intraspecific trait variation (ITV) and species turnover underlying the grazing induced changes in above- and below-ground functional trait composition of plant communities.  Six aboveground traits (i.e. plant height, plant aboveground biomass, plant density, leaf area, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf density) and three root traits (average root diameter, ARD; specific root length, SRL; and root tissue density, RTD) of the first-, second- and third-order roots (1<sup>st</sup>-, 2<sup>nd</sup>-, and 3<sup>rd</sup>-) were measured at the plant individual level. </li>
	<li>At the community level, plant above-ground traits shifted towards grazing avoidance strategy (e.g. plant height and leaf area decreased), and below-ground traits shifted towards conservative strategy (i.e. 1<sup>st</sup>-SRL and 2<sup>nd</sup>-SRL decreased, 1<sup>st</sup>-RTD and 2<sup>nd</sup>-ARD increased) with increasing grazing intensity.  Functional tradeoffs were found between plant individual biomass and plant density, and between leaf area and leaf density under grazing.  However, community-weighted mean SRL (SRL<sub>CWM</sub>) and ARD (ARD<sub>CWM</sub>) of different root orders exhibited functional coordination under grazing pressure.  SLA<sub>CWM</sub> and SRL<sub>CWM</sub> also showed synergistic responses to grazing.</li>
	<li> The ITV plays a predominant for the changes in above- and below-ground functional trait composition at the community level.  However, changes in mean trait values among plant species with different resource use strategies were mainly triggered by species turnover.  For species with different resource use strategies, grazing exhibited a coordinated effects on ITV but an offset effect on species turnover.</li>
	<li>
<i>Synthesis.</i> Our results demonstrate that both the above- and below-ground trait composition of plant communities shifted toward conservative strategy under long-term grazing.  This study highlights the effects of ITV and species turnover that govern the grazing-induced changes in functional trait composition of plant communities, and has important implications for grazing management in semiarid grasslands.</li>

Succession is generally well described above-ground in the boreal forest, and several studies have demonstrated the role of interspecific facilitation in tree species establishment. However the role of mycorrhizal communities for tree establishment and interspecific facilitation, has been little explored. At the ecotone between the mixed boreal forest, dominated by balsam fir and hardwood species, and the boreal forest, dominated by black spruce, several stands of trembling aspen can be found, surrounded by black spruce forest. Regeneration of balsam fir seems to have increased in the recent decades within the boreal forest, and it seems better adapted to grow in trembling aspen stands than in black spruce stands, even when located in similar abiotic conditions. As black spruce stands are also covered by ericaceous shrubs, we investigated if differences in soil fungal communities and ericaceous shrubs abundance could explain the differences observed in balsam fir growth and nutrition. We conducted a study centered on individual saplings to link growth and foliar nutrient concentrations to local vegetation cover, mycorrhization rate and mycorrhizal communities associated with balsam fir roots. We found that foliar nutrient concentrations and ramification indices (colonization by mycorrhiza per length of root) were greater in trembling aspen stands and were positively correlated to apical and lateral growth of balsam fir saplings. In black spruce stands, the presence of ericaceous shrubs near balsam fir saplings affected ectomycorrhizal communities associated with tree roots which in turn negatively correlated with N foliar concentrations. Our results reveal that fungal communities observed under aspen are drivers of balsam fir early growth and nutrition in boreal forest stands and may facilitate ecotone migration in a context of climate change. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">speciesbysamplematrix<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">ECM matrix</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">speciesbysamplematric.csv<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">BF_measures<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Environmental variables measured around each balsam fir sapling</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">needlesnutrientanalyses<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Nutrients measured in needles from balsam fir saplings</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">seqECM<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">DNA sequences from ectomycorrhizal root tips sampled on balsam fir saplings</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div> Ectomycorrhiza; ericaceous shrubs; Abies balsamea; Picea mariana Canada; Abitibi-Témiscamingue and Nord du Québec region; Québec","2019-07-30","3,4",NA,"yes","L","repository",".csv","site IDs","not given","site coordinates","black spruce","2015-2016","2015","2016","source publication text","1","dataset","36","source publication text","presence only","NA","NA","Frontiers in Plant Science","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2019.00932","no","zenodo"

The forest is subjected to a temperate marine climate with mild winters and summers and an annual rainfall of approximately 800 mm (KNMI, 2009). The soil is described as a calcareous and nutrient-rich clay soil with a homogeneous texture throughout the forest, and the groundwater table ranges between 1.6 and 1.2 m below the soil surface (Weemstra et al., 2013).</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><span style=""font-style:italic;""><span lang=""EN-GB"" style=""font-style:normal;"">Fine-root mass and morphology were measured in three monospecific forest plots per species. Per plot, three soil samples up to 1 m depth and randomly distributed over the plot were collected using a 42 mm-diameter root auger, the roots washed out, separated into fine and coarse roots based on their diameter (fine roots being &lt; 2 mm diameter) and weighed. As roots were sampled with a root auger and cut into smaller fragments, we were unable to accurately sort roots based on their order. Fine roots were scanned, the scans were analysed with WinRhizo (Regent Instruments, Quebec, Canada) to determine total fine-root length, mean diameter and mean root volume, and the fine roots were oven-dried at 60° C for 48h to determine dry mass. Fine-root SRL was calculated by dividing fine-root length by dry weight, fine-root tissue density was calculated by dividing fine-root dry weight by fine-root volume, and fine-root length density (fine-root length per soil volume) was calculated by multiplying SRL and fine-root mass. </span></span></p> 1.	The root economics spectrum (RES) hypothesis predicts that fast-growing tree species have short-lived roots with high specific root length (SRL) to allow rapid resource uptake, and opposite trait expressions for slow-growing species. Yet, the mixed support for this hypothesis suggests that trees can adopt alternative strategies to increase resource uptake, besides an increase in SRL.
2.	We combined a novel mechanistic whole-tree model and empirical fine-root data of ten tree species to test the effects of one of these alternative strategies, notably increasing fine-root mass, on the tree's net C gain (used here as a proxy for tree performance), and to assess how fine-root lifespan influences the relative importance of SRL and fine-root mass for the C balance of trees.
3.	Our results indicate that accounting for the short lifespan of high-SRL roots has important implications for explaining tree performance and the role of roots herein. Without considering their faster turnover, high-SRL roots and low fine-root mass resulted in the highest performance as predicted from the RES. Yet, when their higher turnover rates were accounted for, a high fine-root mass and low SRL lead to the highest performance. Both our model outcomes and field data further show a negative relationship between SRL and fine-root mass through which species aim to realise a similar root length density. This trade-off further indicates how high a SRL and low fine-root mass as well as opposite trait values can both lead to a positive C balance in a similar environment.
4.	Our study may explain why high-SRL roots do not necessarily lead to the fastest tree growth as often hypothesised and demonstrates the importance of fine-root mass in combination with fine-root lifespan for explaining interspecific differences in tree performance. More generally, our work demonstrates the value of identifying and investigating different belowground strategies across species from a whole-plant modelling perspective, and identifies the relationship between SRL, fine-root biomass and lifespan as an important functional dimension to variation in species' performance. <p>Funding provided by: Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: 022.002.004</p><p>Funding provided by: Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: 864.14.006</p> carbon balance; fine roots; root economics spectrum; tree performance; whole-plant model; temperate trees; interspecific root traits","2020-01-05","3,10","location","no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA","NA","NA","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2013.06.007; https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.13520","no",NA

YOY juveniles were individuals less than 1 year old (&lt;15 cm long). Saint John juveniles were 1–4 years old and largely spawned in the year 2013. Ages for Saint John River juveniles were obtained from scales. Adults were sexually mature individuals aged 4 years and older. All adults collected were in spawning condition at time of sampling, except for Bras d'Or Lake, Mira River, and Shubenacadie River. Shubenacadie origin Striped Bass migrate to the Stewiacke-Shubenacadie systems from overwintering sites during the sampling period (DFO, 2014; Keyser, Broome, Bradford, Sanderson, &amp; Redden, 2016). Adult bass caught during this period are assumed to be of Shubenacadie River origin for the purpose of population surveys (DFO, 2014). Putative Miramichi River origin Striped Bass were included using fin clips taken from Striped Bass caught in the Bras d'Or Lake, Cape Breton that have previously been examined using microsatellites and found to match the Miramichi River population (Bentzen, Mcbride, &amp; Paterson, 2014).

Cutadapt v. 1.13 (Martin, 2011) was used to trim adapters from the raw sequences using a maximum error rate (e) of 0.2 and a minimum read length (m) of 50. FastQC v. 0.11.5 (Babraham Bioinformatics) was used to assess sequence quality before and after. Sequences were then trimmed to a uniform length of 85 bp and demultiplexed using the <i>process radtags</i> module of Stacks v. 1.46 (Catchen, Hohenlohe, Bassham, Amores, &amp; Cresko, 2013) using the paired end option –P. BWA version 0.7.15 (Li &amp; Durbin, 2010) was used to align sequences to the Striped Bass genome (BioProject accession number PRJNA266827) using a minimum seed length (k) of 19, a maximum seed occurrence of 55, and no filtering on output alignment score, and otherwise default parameters. The stacks module <i>pstacks</i> identified reference aligned loci with a minimum depth (m) of 4 using the ""snp"" model type and an alpha of 0.1. Loci were assembled into a catalogue using <i>cstacks</i>, <i>sstacks</i>, and <i>rxstacks</i> with default settings, and unclear or unlikely haplotypes, as well as SNPs with a log likelihood &lt; 45, were pruned from the dataset. Using the <i>populations</i> module, SNPs were further filtered to remove all loci with a stack depth &lt;5, with greater than 20% missing data in any given location, and any loci not amplified in all locations. We examined the output of populations and removed loci with an Fis &lt; -0.3 to eliminate possible paralogs, and used VCFTools 0.1.13 (Danecek et al., 2011) to remove any loci with a minor allele frequency &lt; 0.01, and plink v. 1.90 (Chang et al., 2015) was used to remove loci in linkage disequilibrium with each other.</p> <p>Striped Bass, Morone saxatilis (Walbaum, 1792), is an anadromous fish species that supports fisheries throughout North America and is native to the North American Atlantic Coast. Due to long coastal migrations that span multiple jurisdictions, a detailed understanding of population genomics is required to untangle demographic patterns, understand local adaptation, and characterize population movements. This study used 1256 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci to investigate genetic structure of 477 Striped Bass sampled from 15 locations spanning the North American Atlantic coast from the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada to the Cape Fear River, United States (US). We found striking differences in neutral divergence among Canadian sites, which were isolated from each other and US populations, compared with US populations that were much less isolated. Our SNP dataset was able to assign 99% of Striped Bass back to six reporting groups, a 39% improvement over previous genetic markers. Using this method, we found (1) evidence of admixture within Saint John River, indicating that migrants from the US and from Shubenacadie River occasionally spawn in the Saint John River; (2) Striped Bass collected in the Mira River, Cape Breton, Canada were found to be of both Miramichi River and US origin ; (3) juveniles in the newly restored Kennebec River population had small and nonsignificant differences from the Hudson River; and (4) tributaries within the Chesapeake Bay showed a mixture of homogeny and small differences among each other.

The ability to move between habitats has important implications for fitness in many species. In-stream barriers such as culverts can impede movements of riverine fishes and thus reduce connectivity between habitats. The ability of fish to overcome barriers is related to the features of the environment and the barrier itself, but also to physiological, morphological, and behavioural traits of the fish. Among these, body shape varies among and within species and influences swimming ability, a key component of passage performance through culverts.
2.	We conducted an experimental study on wild brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) to assess the effects of individual body shape on attempt rate and passage success through culverts on six streams.
3.	A more streamlined body shape was associated with an increased motivation to enter and ascend the culverts, and, to a lesser extent, with the probability of successful passage once an attempt was staged. Motivation and successful passage were also influenced by the density of conspecifics below the culvert, time of day, fish body size, and water velocity.
4.	 Policy implications
While fish body shape is expected to influence swimming performance, our research shows the most important effect of body shape to be on an individual's motivation to stage passage attempts at culverts. This study points to an important connection between behaviour and morphological traits that influence passage success and suggests that in-stream barriers may be an important agent of selection on behavior and morphology in wild fish populations. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Goerigetal_BodyShapeCulvertPassage<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">This data package allows reproducing all analysis and figures included in the article.

Three sites in each of the dominant vegetation types were randomly selected in a radius of five kilometers around each region's research station prior to fieldwork (Figure 1b). Minimal distance between sampling sites was set to 250 meters. For each polygon of the vegetation map, a 250 m-wide buffer zone was excluded to ensure that sampling was conducted in the central section of the polygon. The final site selection consisted in a total of 42 sites and included three sites of each of the following dominant vegetation types: lichen woodland, open subarctic heathland (thereafter open area), and shrubland in Clearwater Lake and Boniface River (the two southernmost regions), open area and shrubland in LeRoy Lake and Payne Lake, herbaceous tundra in Chukotat River, and herbaceous tundra and shrubland in Deception Bay.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">For each of the study sites, a 30 m x 40 m quadrat was positioned in a representative portion of the site. Twenty 1 m-long linear surveys were randomly positioned along parallel transects placed every two meters along the largest (40 m) side of the quadrat . Macrolichens (fruticose, foliose and squamulose lichens) were identified to the species level according to the floras of Brodo, Sharnoff, &amp; Sharnoff, (2001), Hinds &amp; Hinds (2007), and Thomson &amp; Brehmer, (1984). Crustose lichens were not identified. Terricolous and saxicolous lichen cover was measured by species for each 10 cm segment along every 1 m-long linear survey. The measurements made on these ten segments were summed to obtain a precise estimate of each species cover to the nearest centimeter on the 1-m long survey. Species for which cover was &lt; 1 cm were assigned a cover of 0.5 cm. Vegetation cover was also evaluated for the following plant functional groups: erect shrubs (&gt; 15 cm-high), prostrate shrubs (&lt; 15 cm-high), graminoids, forbs and bryophytes. For each 1 m-long transect, we measured the height and evaluated the canopy closure of erect shrubs, using the following cover classes: 0-25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, and 75-100%. Soil organic layer thickness was measured at the center of every survey transect and five soil samples were collected systematically at every site. Soil pH was evaluated using the mean pH value of the five soil samples collected during the field campain. Soil samples were first dried in paper bags at room temperature during the field campain and soil pH was measured using a pH-meter by suspending soil material in distilled water with a 1:1 ratio once back at Laval University (Eckert &amp; Sims, 1995). For each site, we also summed the cover of each vegetation functional group measured in the field and calculated the mean value of the soil organic layer thickness.</p>

Natural environments are, however, rarely homogenous and species often find themselves viewed against varied backgrounds where the task of concealment is more challenging. One result of variable backgrounds is the evolution of intraspecific phenotypic variation which may either be generalized, with multiple similarly cryptic patterns, or specialized, with each discrete color form maximizing concealment against a single component of the background. We investigated the role of phenotypic variation in a highly variable population of the Neotropical toad <em>Rhinella margaritifera</em> using visual modeling and a computer-based detection task. We found that phenotypic variation was not divided into discrete color morphs and all toads were well camouflaged against the forest floor. However, although the whole population may appear to consist of random samples from the background, the toads were a particularly close match to the leaf litter, suggesting that they masquerade as dead leaves, which are themselves variable. Furthermore, rather than each color form being equally effective against a single background, each toad was specialized towards its own particular local surroundings, as suggested by a specialist strategy. Taken together, these data highlight the importance of background matching to a nominally masquerading species, as well as how habitat heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales may affect the evolution of camouflage and phenotypic variation.</p> <p>Funding provided by: University of Bristol<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000883<br>Award Number: Postgraduate scholarship</p><p>Funding provided by: Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794<br>Award Number: ANR-10-LABX-25-01</p><p>Funding provided by: Le Fonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et Technologies postdoctoral fellowship*<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: PBEEE–V2: 263478</p>","2021-09-14","3,6","location","no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","no","zenodo"
"73",73,"https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.b46k4","Data from: Threshold dynamics in plant succession after tree planting in agricultural riparian zones","Data from: Threshold dynamics in plant succession after tree planting in agricultural riparian zones  Trajectories of plant communities can be described by different models of plant succession. While a Clementsian (gradual continuum model) or Gleasonian approach (relay floristics model) has traditionally been used to inform restoration outcomes, alternative succession models developed recently may better represent restoration trajectories. The threshold dynamics succession model, which predicts an abrupt species turnover after an environmental threshold is crossed, has never been used in a restoration context. This model might, however, better describe shifts in plant competitive ranking and facilitation interactions during species turnover.
Fifty-three riparian zones, planted with trees 3–17 years prior to sampling, and 14 natural riparian forests were studied in two agricultural watersheds of south-eastern Québec (Canada). The cover of vegetation strata was assessed at the site scale, and the cover of plant species was estimated in a total of 784 1-m2 plots. Canopy cover was measured stereoscopically for each plot.
As revealed by Principal Response Curves and broken stick models, herbaceous species composition was stable during the first 12–13 years after tree planting, but then abruptly shifted. This two-step pattern in species turnover followed the increase in canopy cover after tree planting. Once canopy cover passed a threshold of ca 40%, plant succession started and led to the re-establishment of forest communities 17 years after planting.
Following herbaceous species turnover, the cover of ecological groups changed significantly towards covers of natural riparian forests: shade-tolerant species generally increased, while light-demanding and non-native species decreased. Vegetation structure was also significantly affected by tree planting: tree and shrub cover increased, while monocot cover decreased.
Synthesis and applications. Tree planting efficiently restored herbaceous forest communities in riparian zones by inducing a species turnover mediated by light availability corresponding to the threshold dynamics model in plant succession. Fostering and monitoring canopy closure in tree-planted riparian zones should improve restoration success and the design of alternative strategies. The innovative statistical approach of this study aiming to identify succession patterns and their associated theoretical models can guide future restoration in any type of ecosystem around the world to bridge the gap between science and management. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Data_Bourgeois_et_al_2016_JApplEcol<div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div> Succession models; Vegetation recovery; Herbaceous communities; Canopy cover; riparian zones; Agricultural landscapes","2016-04-15","3,7,8",NA,"yes","L","repository",".xlsx","site IDs","not given","site coordinates","c.150 plant species","2012","2012","2012","source publication text",">1","not given","200","not given","density","NA","NA","Journal of Applied Ecology","https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12675","no","zenodo"

<p> </p> <p><span>According to the island syndrome and island rule hypotheses, island isolation and reduced area lead to phenotypic shifts in ecologically relevant traits in insular populations compared to mainland ones. These hypotheses have been built up with oceanic islands in mind or islands where isolation is high and colonization rate relatively limited. This set of hypotheses, however, may not be applicable to other inland-island systems or recently fragmented landscapes. </span></p>

<p><span>We investigated how island life leads to phenotypic changes in two rodent metapopulations: deer mice and red-backed voles in a fragmented system on a river in Canada. From 2013 to 2016, we sampled 454 deer mice and 665 red-backed voles spread across 10 islands and six mainland sites on river shores. We compared body mass, tail and hindfoot length, exploration, and reaction towards predators, between individuals from island and mainland sites, and assessed the role of connectivity, isolation and area of islands. </span></p>

<p><span>Insular individuals from both species were less aggressive towards potential predators and insular mice were more thorough explorers compared to mainland ones. Male mice were heavier and juvenile mice had longer tails on islands. However, contrary to expectations, we found negative relationships between aggressiveness and juvenile exploration score with patch connectivity for mice. Island connectivity significantly affected tail length of mice through a concave relationship. Finally, vole aggressiveness and exploration of male mice were positively correlated to island isolation. </span></p>

<p><span>Our study supports only partially the predictions of the island syndrome hypothesis. It provides empirical evidence that inland-island life can modify traits in deer mice, but less so in red-backed voles in a non-oceanic system.

The dataset is composed by two files (i.e. NaturalSelection and NaturalSexualSelection), each including 36 files of datasets (i.e. TypeOfSelection_ForagingPeriod_ChoosingPeriod_PatchQuality_CognitiveCost). Every file is composed by three document.txt (i.e. AnalyseLinkSRFemaleCriterionEvolutionFile, AnalyseLinkSRFemalePrecisionEvolution, AnalyseLinkSRMaleTraitEvolution) representing the datasets for each relevant trait in our simulation (i.e. female selectivity trait, female accuracy trait and male cognitive trait respectively). Each dataset contains the mean and sd reproductive success for each the trait value, the generation (i.e. from 0 to 999) and the range (i.e. from 5 to 185 food patch number, by 5). These datasets allowed us to create all figures of the mean frequency of each male and female trait values in 360 environmental conditions, under natural selection alone and under natural and sexual selection. </span></p> <p><span>There has been an increased focus on the role of natural and sexual selection in shaping cognitive abilities, but the importance of the interaction between both forces remain largely unknown. Intersexual selection through female mate choice might be an important driver of the evolution of cognitive traits, especially in monogamous species, where females may obtain direct fitness benefits by choosing mates with better cognitive abilities. However, the importance given by females to male cognitive traits might vary among species and/or populations according to their life-history traits and ecology. To disentangle the effects of natural and sexual selection, here we use an agent-based simulation model and compare the model's predictions when females mate with the first randomly encountered male (i.e. under natural selection) versus when they choose among males based on their cognitive trait values (i.e. under natural and intersexual selection). Males and females are characterized, respectively, by their problem-solving ability and assessment strategy. At each generation, agents go through (1) a choosing phase during which females assess the cognitive abilities of potential mates until eventually finding an acceptable one, and (2) a reproductive phase during which all males compete for limited resources that are exploited at a rate which depends on their cognitive abilities. Because males provide paternal care, the foraging success of mated males determines the breeding success of the pair through its effect on nestling provisioning efficiency. The model predicts that intersexual selection plays a major role in most ecological conditions, by either reinforcing or acting against the effect of natural selection. The latter case occurs under harsh environmental conditions, where intersexual selection contributes to maintaining cognitive diversity. Our findings thus demonstrate the importance of considering the interaction between both selective forces and highlight the need to build a conceptual framework to target relevant cognitive traits.</span></p> <p><span>The simulation model was developed using the Python programming language, while the simulations were run on Canada compute servers (Calcul Quebec).

Yet, classic predator–prey models assume spatially homogeneous interactions between predators and prey. We developed a spatially informed theory that predicts how habitat heterogeneity alters the landscape-scale distribution of mortality risk of prey from predation, and hence the nature of predator interactions in multiprey systems. The theoretical model is a spatially explicit, multiprey functional response in which species-specific advection–diffusion models account for the response of individual prey to habitat edges. The model demonstrates that distinct responses of alternative prey species can alter the consequences of conspecific aggregation, from increasing safety to increasing predation risk. Observations of threatened boreal caribou, moose and grey wolf interacting over 378 181 km2 of human-managed boreal forest support this principle. This empirically supported theory demonstrates how distinct responses of apparent competitors to landscape heterogeneity, including to human disturbances, can reverse density dependence in fitness correlates. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Wolf data<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data used to carry out habitat selection analysis of molves</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Wolf.xlsx<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Moose data<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data used to carry out habitat selection analysis of moose</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Moose.xlsx<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">mortality_Caribou<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data used to analyse the probability of mortality of 145 radio-collar caribou as a function of their distance from the nearest road of cut.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div> apparent competition; Caribou; Rangifer tarandus; Alces alces; Canis lupus; mortality risk","2015-07-14","3,10",NA,"yes","X","repository",".xlsx",NA,NA,NA,"wolf, moose",NA,NA,NA,"not given",NA,NA,"378181","source link abstract, source publication text","presence only","NA","NA","Proceedings of the Royal Society B","https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2015.0973","no",NA

<p style=""margin-bottom:13px;"">Seed was collected from an individual in the native range of <i>C. diffusa</i> (TR001-1; Table S1). Seed from this collection was grown in a greenhouse at the University of British Columbia in 2009. Young leaf tissue was sampled from one progeny (TR001-1L) and stored at -80° C to be used for draft reference genome assembly. DNA was extracted from frozen tissue using a modified Qiagen DNeasy column-less protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Concentration and quality were verified by Nanodrop, Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and gel electrophoresis. A whole genome shotgun library for this individual was produced and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 100 bp paired-end sequencing (Genome Quebec).<span style=""background:white;""> This produced ~69 million reads and ~14 Gbp, for a sequencing depth of ~16X. Raw reads were quality trimmed and screened for sequencing artifacts using Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014). </span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:13px;""><span style=""background:white;"">To produce the plastome assembly, clean reads were aligned to the <i>Lactuca sativa</i> plastome (Timme et al., 2007) using BWA (</span>Li &amp; Durbin, 2009<span style=""background:white;"">). Pairs in which both reads aligned to the <i>L. sativa </i>plastome were extracted from the SAM files with Picard Tools SamToFastq.jar (</span>Picard 2009<span style=""background:white;"">). ALLPATHS-LG (Gnerre et al., 2011) was used to merge overlapping pairs and error-correct the data, which was then assembled with Ray (Boisvert et al., 2010). Ray contigs were aligned to the <i>L. sativa </i>plastome with BLAST+ (Altschul et al., 1990) and scaffolded based on synteny using OSLay (Richter et al., 2007). Gaps were filled with GapFiller (Boetzer &amp; Pirovano, 2012) resulting in a sequence containing a single 'N'. Visual inspection indicated that the 'N' separated an erroneous tandem duplication, which was corrected by hand with Vim. The boundaries of the inverted repeat (IR) region were confirmed with aTRAM (Allen et al., 2015) assemblies of flanking regions. Reads were aligned to the assembly with BWA and sorted with SAMTOOLS (Li et al., 2009). Visual inspection of the alignment revealed a few small indel and substitution errors, which were hand-corrected with Vim. A final alignment and inspection revealed no errors. </span>The plastome was annotated using DOGMA (Wyman et al., 2004) and validated for NCBI GenBank submission using Sequin 13.05. We used the blastn program (Altschul et al., 1997) to compare the gene content and sequence identity of the <i>C. diffusa</i> and <i>Cynara cardunculus</i> (GenBank: KP842711.1; Curci et al., 2016) plastid genomes. In order to calculate dN, dS, and dN/dS in protein coding regions, we made multiple alignments of the amino acid sequences using Muscle v3.8.31 (Edgar, 2004) and back translated them to codons (Grassa &amp; Kulathinal, 2011). <i>Lactuca sativa</i> plastid genes (GenBank: NC_007578.1; Kanamoto et al., 2004) were also included in the analysis of protein-coding regions. We used the yn00 method (Yang &amp; Nielsen, 2000) in PAML v4.8a (Yang, 2007) to calculate dN, dS, and dN/dS values on the aligned codons.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:13px;"">An additional assembly was made to target the nuclear genome albeit at low depth. Unfiltered trimmed reads were assembled with Megahit (Li et al., 2015). Megahit contigs were repeat masked using Red (Girgis, 2015) and aligned to the Globe Artichoke reference genome (Scaglione et al., 2015) using Blastn (Altschul et al., 1990). These alignments were used as input to Chromosomer (Tamazian et al., 2016), which scaffolds contigs based on the order of homologous regions in a more completely assembled reference genome. Unplaced Megahit contigs were added to the output of Chromosomer to make a reference nuclear sequence. Finally, we polished the pseudomolecules with six iterations of Pilon (Walker et al., 2014) to fix local errors.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:13px;"">The reference nuclear sequence was annotated for putative protein-coding genes using three types of evidence: <i>ab initio</i> Hidden Markov Model-based predictions, protein homology, and expressed sequence tags. <i>Ab initio predictions</i> were made using Augustus (Stanke et al., 2006) with the gene model trained for tomato (the phylogenetically closest model available at the time of analysis). Viridiplantae proteins were downloaded from RefSeq (O'Leary et al., 2016) and clustered at 90% identity with CD-HIT (Fu et al., 2012). Representative peptide sequences were first aligned to the nuclear reference with the Diamond (Buchfink et al., 2015) in sensitive mode to quickly identify candidate regions with sequence homology to known proteins. Peptides were realigned to the nuclear sequence at candidate loci using the more sensitive, but longer running, AAT (Huang et al., 1997). Assembled ESTs from a native (TR001-1L; the same individual used for this reference assembly) and invasive (US022-31E) genotype (Lai et al., 2012) were aligned with GMAP (Wu et al., 2016). The three lines of evidence were combined using Evidence Modeler (Haas et al., 2008) to generate the gene coordinates.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:13px;""><i>Genome-wide association study</i></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:13px;"">Seeds were collected as part of a broad collaborative effort from four native range and four invaded range <i>C. diffusa</i> populations (Fig 1; Table S1). Field collection took place between 2006 – 2008. Because maternal environmental effects can have strong, even adaptive, impacts on offspring phenotype in some systems (Galloway, 2005), we used individuals grown for two generations in a common environment to reduce maternal effects in this study. Specifically, field collected seed from these populations were raised in a greenhouse and crossed within populations (as previously reported in Turner et al., 2014). The seeds produced by those crosses were raised in a benign control environment, provided with ample resources, and phenotyped (as reported in Turner et al., 2014). Briefly, the 381 <i>C. diffusa </i>individuals included in this study were phenotyped as follows: Basal leaf number and length and width of the longest basal leaf for each individual was assessed three times during the experiment: beginning 7 wks after germination (at the mean 15 leaf stage), 10 wks after germination, and at harvest, and the maximum value was noted. At the end of the experiment, 19-20 wks after germination, the diameter at the interface between root and stem was assessed. In addition, two or three young leaves were sampled for DNA extraction and stored at -80 C, and one mature leaf was harvested to measure specific leaf area (SLA). Leaves for SLA were scanned and area measured using ImageJ 1.45s (Rasband, 2011) then dried at 29° C and weighed. The rest of the above ground biomass was harvested, dried, and weighed. These phenotypes were summarized into the following values for use in the GWAS analysis: (1) maximum leaf count, (2) maximum leaf width, (3) maximum leaf length, (4) root crown diameter, (5) shoot mass, and (6) SLA.</p>

<p class=""Normal1"" style=""margin-bottom:13px;"">To genotype individuals, DNA was extracted from young leaves using a Qiagen DNeasy 96 Plant Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and assessed for quantity using a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). High quality DNA from 381 individuals was used to produce PstI-MspI genotype-by-sequencing libraries using a modified version of the protocol described in Poland et al. (2012). Briefly, we treated genomic DNA with HF-PstI and MspI at 37 °C for 5 hours. We ligated barcoded adaptors and barcoded common Y-shaped adaptors (Poland et al., 2012) to digested DNA at 22 °C for 3 hours. <a name=""-224122801_article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p5""></a>We pooled groups of 96 ligated samples, which were then purified using the Agencourt AMPure XP system and amplified by PCR using KAPPA HiFi Hotstart master mix. Finally, we selected DNA fragments between 300-500 bp using the Agencourt AMPure XP system for paired-end 100bp sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Sequencing runs resulted in ~402 million reads passing initial quality control at the sequencing facility, with an average quality score of 36.</p>

<p class=""Normal1"" style=""margin-bottom:13px;"">Raw sequencing reads were de-multiplexed and data for each individual from all lanes were concatenated. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were called against the assembled reference sequence using dDocent v2.6.0 (Puritz et al., 2014). dDocent combines several existing software packages into a single pipeline designed specifically for paired-end GBS/RAD data and takes advantage of both forward and reverse reads for SNP discovery. SNPs were called based on a larger set of <i>Centaurea</i> individuals, including the 381 GWAS set and 54 individuals from additional populations. Then, using the individuals in this GWAS study only, SNPs were filtered for quality and missing data. The resulting variant call file (VCF) was filtered using vcftools v0.1.15 (Danecek et al., 2011) to a minimum quality score of 30, a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 5%, retaining individuals with no more than 40% missing data, and sites missing in no more than 10% of individuals with a minimum mean depth value greater than 20. Complex variants (multinucleotide polymorphisms and composite insertions and substitutions) were decomposed into SNP and indel representation following Puritz et al. (2014), retaining only one biallelic SNP per locus. Further filtering steps were performed to remove SNPs likely to be the result of sequencing errors, paralogs, multicopy loci or artifacts of library preparation (Methods S1). We concatenated SNPs found on unplaced scaffolds onto a single contig for analysis, and, because most GWAS analyses do not tolerate missing data, we replaced unknown genotypes with heterozygous calls. Using only SNPs without any missing data substantially decreases the number of SNPs that we could test but did not affect our results. The final data set used in downstream analyses consisted of 7058 SNPs found in 372 individuals from eight populations represented by 6-169 individuals (Fig. 1; Table S1).</p>

<p class=""Normal1"" style=""margin-bottom:13px;"">We used compressed mixed linear models (<a href=""http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v42/n4/full/ng.546.html"" target=""_blank""><span>Zhang et al., 2010</span></a>) implemented in GAPIT (Lipka et al., 2012) to test for associations between SNPs and our phenotypes. To avoid spurious associations and account for relatedness between our individuals, our models included a kinship matrix, which was calculated using the default settings for the VanRaden (2008) algorithm. This kinship matrix was validated against the known pedigree for these individuals from the greenhouse crossing design, and our results were not affected by using alternative ways to account for relatedness. To further account for population structure in our population, we used the Bayesian information criterion (BIC)-based model selection procedure implemented in GAPIT to determine the optimal number of principal components to include in our models (up to a maximum of 30) in addition to the calculated kinship matrix.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:13px;"">We searched for genes near significant GWAS hits to gain insight as to what the genetic basis of these traits might be. For each significant GWAS hit we focused on genes located within 500kb in both the upstream and downstream direction; this marked the boundaries for the gene search. Genes identified in this way were functionally annotated based on sequence similarity to <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> using all-against-all BLASTP reciprocal best hits to ESTs in the TAIR 10 database (TAIR, 2020; Berardini et al. 2015). These TAIR 10 loci and associated Gene Ontology terms are reported.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:13px;"">Finally, we put these results in the context of previous work on invasive candidate traits in this system. We determined whether significant GWAS hits were associated with traits that significantly varied between individuals from the native and invasive ranges in previous studies (Turner et al., 2014) and may be candidate invasiveness traits. We used linear mixed effect models in the R package lme4 (R version 3.5; R Core Team, 2018; Bates et al., 2014) and Fisher's exact tests to interrogate the relationships between range (native or invasive), genotypes, and traits. We further assessed overlap between SNPs and genes identified here and previous transcriptomic and gene expression work in this system (Lai et al., 2012; Hodgins et al., 2015; Turner et al., 2017).</p> <p>Invasive species represent excellent opportunities to study the evolutionary potential of traits important to success in novel environments. Although some ecologically-important traits have been identified in invasive species, little is typically known about the genetic mechanisms that underlie invasion success in non-model species. Here, we use a genome-wide association (GWAS) approach to identify the genetic basis of trait variation in the non-model, invasive, diffuse knapweed (<i>Centaurea diffusa </i>Lam.<i> </i>[Asteraceae]). To assist with this analysis, we have assembled the first draft genome reference and fully annotated plastome assembly for this species, and the one of the first from this large, weedy, genus, which is of major ecological and economic importance. We collected phenotype data from 372 individuals from four native and four invasive populations of <i>C. diffusa </i>grown in a common environment. Using these individuals, we produced reduced-representation genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) libraries and identified 7058 SNPs. We identify two SNPs associated with leaf width in these populations, a trait which significantly varies between native and invasive populations. In this rosette forming species, increased leaf width is a major component of increased biomass, a common trait in invasive plants correlated with increased fitness. Finally, we use annotations from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> to identify 98 candidate genes that are near the associated SNPs and highlight several good candidates for leaf width variation.</p> <p>centaurea_final_assembly.tgz - Draft genome assembly and annotation of Centaurea diffusa individual, TR001_1L, from seed collected in Turkey (native range) in 2008.</p>

This is particularly challenging for whales hunted prior to twentieth century modern whaling, as population-level catch records are often incomplete. Assessments of whale recovery using pre-modern exploitation indices are therefore rare, despite the intensive, global nature of nineteenth century whaling. Right whales (Eubalaena spp.) were particularly exploited: slow swimmers with strong fidelity to sheltered calving bays, the species made predictable and easy targets. Here, we present the first integrated population-level assessment of the whaling impact and pre-exploitation abundance of a right whale, the New Zealand southern right whale (E. australis). In this assessment, we use a Bayesian population dynamics model integrating multiple data sources: nineteenth century catches, genetic constraints on bottleneck size and individual sightings histories informing abundance and trend. Different catch allocation scenarios are explored to account for uncertainty in the population's offshore distribution. From a pre-exploitation abundance of 28 800–47 100 whales, nineteenth century hunting reduced the population to approximately 30–40 mature females between 1914 and 1926. Today, it stands at less than 12% of pre-exploitation abundance. Despite the challenges of reconstructing historical catches and population boundaries, conservation efforts of historically exploited species benefit from targets for ecological restoration. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Southern right whale population model<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">This is the R script used to conduct the population assessments.

American shad is a wide ranging anadromous clupeid fish that exhibits variation in demographic histories and reproductive strategies (both semelparity and iteroparity) and provides a unique perspective on the evolutionary processes that govern the genetic architecture of anadromous fishes. Using 13 microsatellite loci, we examined the magnitude and spatial distribution of genetic variation among 33 populations across the species' range to (i) determine whether signals of historical demography persist among contemporary populations and (ii) assess the effect of different reproductive strategies on population structure. Patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation among populations varied widely and reflect the differential influences of historical demography, microevolutionary processes and anthropogenic factors across the species' range. Sequential reductions of diversity with latitude among formerly glaciated rivers are consistent with stepwise postglacial colonization and successive population founder events. Weak differentiation among U.S. iteroparous populations may be a consequence of human-mediated gene flow, while weak differentiation among semelparous populations probably reflects natural gene flow. Evidence for an effect of reproductive strategy on population structure suggests an important role for environmental variation and suggests that the factors that are responsible for shaping American shad life history patterns may also influence population genetic structure. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Rangewide American shad microsatellite data<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Microsatellite dataset for 13 loci genotyped across 33 populations of American shad from across the species native range.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div> reproductive strategies; clinal variation; American shad; Alosa sapidissima Rangewide (Florida to Quebec)","2012-12-13","3,6","location","no","X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Alosa sapidissima",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA","NA","Molecular Ecology","https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.12197","no","dryad"

Here, we present a unique combination of observations and experiments demonstrating that seed predation and soil properties strongly limit regeneration beyond the upper elevational range limit of sugar maple, a tree species of major economic importance. Most strikingly, regeneration beyond the range limit occurred almost exclusively when seeds were experimentally protected from predators. Regeneration from seed was depressed on soil from beyond the range edge when this soil was transplanted to sites within the range, with indirect evidence suggesting that fungal pathogens play a role. Non-climatic factors are clearly in need of careful attention when attempting to predict the biotic consequences of climate change.

We used a combination of Spypoint Force Dark (Spypoint Inc, Victoriaville, Quebec, Canada) and Browning Strike Force (Browning, Morgan, Utah, USA) model cameras. To determine camera locations, we overlaid each study site with a series of 150 m x 150 m grids. Each grid was assigned a number and we randomly chose grids in which cameras would be placed. No grid received more than one camera at a time although at some sites multiple cameras were placed within the same grid at different times of the year. We used this approach to ensure cameras were dispersed across the study sites. Within selected grids, we placed cameras in locations with clear lines of sight for at least 15 m and in locations that would not be visible from roads or trails to avoid theft or the photography of people. We placed cameras on either trees or tripods 50 cm above the ground. We programmed cameras to operate 24 hrs per day, take bursts of 3 photos at each trigger, and to reset after 5 seconds. We downloaded memory cards from cameras approximately every 2 weeks. Due to constraints on the number of cameras, cameras were not deployed at all sites simultaneously and not all sites had equal sampling effort. At each specific location where a camera was deployed, we recorded the coordinates so we could later use a GIS (ArcMap 10.2; ESRI Inc, Redlands, CA, USA) to calculate landscape variables around each camera.</p>

<p>We reviewed all photographs using the Timelapse 2.0 software (Greenberg et al. 2019). Timelapse 2.0 allowed us to rapidly review photographs, extract metadata (date, time), and to assign species identity to each group of photographs. Timelapse 2.0 also allowed us to group photographs into sequences. We assumed all photographs taken within 5 min of one another were one sequence of the same individual and these photographs were combined into one unique detection to reduce double-counting individuals. We chose 5 min for the sequence length because most detections of armadillos foraging in front of cameras lasted for less than 5 min and allowed even slow-moving individuals to move out of range of the camera. We scored each armadillo detection as occurring during day or night based on the sunrise and sunset time for the 15<sup>th</sup> day of that month so that our definitions of diurnal and nocturnal activity varied across the study to account for changing daylengths. We used the time of the first armadillo detection within the sequence to assign the timing of activity.</p> <p>As the human footprint upon the landscape expands, wildlife seeking to avoid human contact are losing the option of altering their spatial distribution and instead are shifting their daily activity patterns to be active at different times than humans.  In this study, we used game cameras to evaluate how human development and activity were related to the daily activity patterns of the nine-banded armadillo (<i>Dasypus novemcinctus)</i> along an urban to rural gradient in Arkansas, USA during the winter of 2020-2021.  We found that armadillos had substantial behavioral plasticity in regard to the timing of their activity patterns; &gt;95% of armadillo activity was nocturnal at six of the study sites whereas between 30 and 60% of activity occurred during the day at 3 other sites.  The likelihood of diurnal armadillo activity was best explained by the distance to downtown Fayetteville (the nearest population center) and estimated ambient sound level (both indices of human activity) with armadillos being most active during the day at quiet sites far from Fayetteville.  Furthermore, armadillo activity occurred later during the night period (minutes after sunset)at sites near downtown and with higher anthropogenic sound.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that the observed activity shift may be in response to not only human activity but the presence of domestic dogs.  Our results provide further evidence that human activity has subtle nonlethal impacts on even common, widespread wildlife species.  Because armadillos have low body temperatures and basal metabolism, being active during cold winter nights likely has measurable fitness costs.  Nature reserves near human population centers may not serve as safe harbors for wildlife as we intend, and managers could benefit from considering these nonlethal responses in how they manage recreation and visitation in these natural areas.</p> <p>See attached file to understand data sheet.</p>

At each sampling site, we randomly established a 50×50 m plot. Within each corner and at the center of this plot, we placed a 10×10 m subplot. At each of these five subplots, we registered all soil and leaf-dwelling ant nests found by systematically searching in the leaf-litter, under rocks, dead trees and logs found within this area for 20 min (modified ""Intensive sampling"" technique described by Bestelmeyer et al., 2000). During this period, we put a flag where the colony was located and proceeded to continue our search. We only collected ant workers after this 20-min search period had ended. We collected a subset of at least 5-10 workers to sample.</p>
<p>We measured nine raw morphological traits that are regularly used in the literature: (1) Body size (Weber's length), (2) pronotum width, (3) head length and (4) head width, (5) eye length and (6) eye width, (7) mandible length, (8) antenna (scape) length and (9) Femur length, following a standardized protocol suggested by Parr et al. (2017). At each site, we found between 1 to 24 colonies per species, and we measured all nine traits on 1 to 3 individual workers from each colony. for monomorphic species, we measured 1 to 3 specimens per colony. Then, for polymorphic species (e.g., Pheidole spp., Camponotus spp.), we visually selected and measured one representative of each size class (i.e., majors, intermediate and minors). We took standard linear measurements using an ocular micrometer mounted on a dissecting microscope, accurate to 0.01 mm.</p>
<p>The macroenvironmental variables for each of the 20 sites: annual mean temperature and annual precipitation were extracted from WorldClim 2.0 (Fick &amp; Hijmans, 2017).</p> <p>1. Quantifying trait-environment associations can help elucidate the processes underpinning the structure of species assemblages. However, most work has focused on trait variation across rather than within species, meaning that processes operating at the intraspecific levels cannot be detected. Incorporating intraspecific trait variation in community-wide analyses can provide valuable insights about the role of morphological adaptation and plasticity on species persistence and the composition of ecological communities.</p>
<p>2. Here, we assessed geographic variation in the direction (i.e., adaptation) and strength of selection, and the magnitude of plasticity, by examining community-wide trait variation in ant communities along an environmental gradient spanning 9° latitude in Quebec, Canada. Specifically, we measured 9 morphological traits related to foraging strategies, resource use and thermal regulation at 20 locations across temperate and boreal forests. We then examined how the mean and variance of these traits varied along temperature and precipitation gradients. Moreover, we examined how these trait-environment relationships varied across levels of organization, from individual workers (intraspecific) to colonies (intraspecific) and species (interspecific).</p>
<p>3. We observed changes in mean trait values along environmental gradients, but very little change in variance. Specifically, we observed a decrease in the mean length of antennae and an increase in the mean eye length from mild (warm and wet) to more extreme environments (cold and dry). These shifts in trait means were mostly coordinated across organizational levels (i.e., worker, colony, and species). We also observed a general increase in trait variance from mild to extreme environments, but only at the species level.</p>
<p>4. Our findings suggest that stressful environmental conditions exert a strong selection pressure on ant morphology causing shifts in optimal trait values. These adaptations may enable persistence at the northern edge of the boreal forest and therefore influence the composition of these ant communities. Specifically, ants with large eyes and short antennae are overrepresented at the transition zone between the boreal forest and the tundra, possibly representing an adaptation to these more open habitats. Our study demonstrates that combining spatial and community-wide intraspecific functional trait data provides a promising way forward to gain new insights on trait adaptations and processes underpinning community structure along environmental gradients.</p> <p>Please see ""readme.txt"" file for details of files.</p><p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: NSERC-CREATE in Biodiversity, Ecosystem Services, and Sustainability (BESS)</p><p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: NSERC Discovery Grant (RGPIN-2015-06081)</p><p>Funding provided by: Concordia University<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002914<br>Award Number: Concordia University Research Chair in Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function</p> adaptation; Ant morphology; community assembly; environmental filtering; functional traits; plasticity; Trait-environment relationship","2022-09-19","3,7,8",NA,"yes","M","repository",".xlsx","site coordinates site IDs","not given","Map","37 ant species","2017","2017","2017","source publication text",">1","source link abstract","140000","not given","presence-absence","NA","NA","Functional Ecology","NA","no","zenodo"

Obtain and extract the 19 bioclimatic variables at all points, 4. Select ecological variables least correlated with each other and most correlated with butternut presence. The BRT model that predicted butternut's ecological niche was then used to hypothesize butternut's suitable habitat and range shifts in the past.

A previous investigation reported that <em>Juglans cinerea</em> (butternut) has lower genetic diversity at higher latitudes, hypothesized to be the result of range shifts following the last glacial period. However, genetic patterns can also be impacted by modern ecogeographic conditions. Therefore, we re-investigate genetic patterns of butternut with additional northern population sampling, hindcasted species distribution models, and fossil pollen records to clarify the impact of glaciation on butternut.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Eastern North America</p>
<p><strong>Taxon:</strong> <em>Juglans cinerea </em>(L., Juglandaceae) (butternut)</p>
<p><strong>Methods:</strong> Using 11 microsatellites, we examined range-wide spatial patterns of genetic diversity metrics (allelic richness, heterozygosity, FST) for previously studied butternut individuals and an additional 757 samples. We constructed hindcast species distribution models and mapped fossil pollen records to evaluate habitat suitability and evidence of species' presence throughout space and time.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Contrary to previous work on butternut, we found that genetic diversity increased with distance to range edge, and previous latitudinal clines in diversity were likely due to a few outlier populations. Populations in New Brunswick, Canada were genetically distinct from other populations. At the Last Glacial Maximum, pollen records demonstrate butternut likely persisted near the glacial margin, and hindcast species distribution models identified suitable habitat in the southern United States and near Nova Scotia.</p>
<p><strong>Main conclusions: </strong>Genetic patterns in butternut may be shaped by both glaciation and modern environmental conditions. Pollen records and hindcast species distribution models combined with genetic distinctiveness in New Brunswick suggest that butternut may have persisted in cryptic northern refugia. We suggest that thorough sampling across a species range and evaluating multiple lines of evidence are essential to understanding past species movements.</p> <p>Data was cleaned and processed in R - genetic data cleaning and analyses and species distribution modeling methods were performed in <a href=""https://github.com/ekschumacher/butternut"">Emily Schumacher's butternut repository</a> and fossil pollen data cleaning and modeling was performed in <a href=""https://github.com/alissab/juglans"">Alissa Brown's juglans repository</a>.

Interactions between drought and insect defoliation may dramatically alter forest function under novel climate and disturbance regimes, but remain poorly understood. We empirically tested two important hypotheses regarding tree responses to drought and insect defoliation: 1) trees exhibit delayed, persistent, and cumulative growth responses to these stressors; 2) physiological feedbacks in tree responses to these stressors exacerbate their impacts on tree growth. These hypotheses remain largely untested at a landscape scale, yet are critical for predicting forest function under novel future conditions given the connection between tree growth and demographic processes such as mortality and regeneration.
2. We developed a Bayesian hierarchical model to quantify the ecological memory of tree growth to past water deficits and insect defoliation events, derive antecedent variables reflecting the persistent and cumulative effects of these stressors on current growth, and test for their interactive effects. The model was applied to extensive tree growth, weather, and defoliation survey data from western and eastern regions of the Canadian boreal forest impacted by recent drought and defoliation events and characterized by contrasting tree compositions, climates, and insect defoliators.
3. Results revealed persistent negative tree growth responses to past water (all trees) and defoliation (host trees) stress lasting 3-6 and 10-12 years, respectively, depending on study region. Accounting for the ecological memory of tree growth to water and defoliation stress allowed for detection of interactions not previously demonstrated. Contrary to expectations, we found evidence for positive interactions among non-host trees likely due to reduced water stress following defoliation events. Regional differences in ecological memory to water stress highlight the role of climate in shaping forest responses to drought.
4. Synthesis. Study results suggest negative feedbacks in tree responses to drought and insect attack may be weaker than predicted for defoliator-dominated boreal forest systems. Instead, insect defoliation may offset the impacts of water deficit on boreal tree growth by reducing transpirational water demand. This offset mimics increased resistance to drought following forest thinning and may lessen growth and mortality losses due to increased aridity and more severe insect damage forecast for the boreal forest under global change. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Tree growth, defoliation, and climatic water deficit data<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Individual tree growth along with stand-level defoliation and weather data are provided for each study region.

Because they also may affect mate choice, they are candidates for having great importance in ecological speciation. Here, we use next-generation sequencing to test the general hypothesis of parallelism in patterns of MHCIIβ diversity and bacterial infections among five dwarf and normal whitefish sympatric pairs. A second objective was to assess the functional relationships between specific MHCIIβ alleles and pathogens in natural conditions. Each individual had between one and four alleles, indicating two paralogous loci. In Cliff Lake, the dwarf ecotype was monomorphic for the most common allele. In Webster Lake, the skew in the allelic distribution was towards the same allele but in the normal ecotype, underscoring the nonparallel divergence among lakes. Our signal of balancing selection matched putative peptide binding region residues in some cases, but not in others, supporting other recent findings of substantial functional differences in fish MHCIIβ compared with mammals. Individuals with fewer alleles were less likely to be infected; thus, we found no evidence for the heterozygote advantage hypothesis. MHCIIβ alleles and pathogenic bacteria formed distinct clusters in multivariate analyses, and clusters of certain alleles were associated with clusters of pathogens, or sometimes the absence of pathogens, indicating functional relationships at the individual level. Given that patterns of MHCIIβ and bacteria were nonparallel among dwarf and normal whitefish pairs, we conclude that pathogens driving MHCIIβ evolution did not play a direct role in their parallel phenotypic evolution. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">R_scripts_inputs_outputs.tar<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Here are the R scripts as well as input and output files for the statistical analyses for this paper.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">SplitsTree.tar<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">This folder contains the fasta input files and nexus files for each of the two splitstree networks in the paper.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Pathogen_data.tar<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Sequence data from Lake whitefish kidney tissue for both dwarf and normal forms from all five lakes</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">MHC_454<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">This compressed file contains two folders with all of the raw 454 files for MHCIIb for this project.

We divided the study area into 37 irregular cells of ~7.5 km<sup>2</sup> and placed a hair-snag station as close as possible to the center of 33 of these cells; the four remaining cells were discarded due to their inaccessibility and steep slopes. Hair-snag stations were composed of two barbwires fixed on tree trunks 35 cm and 65 cm aboveground to delineate an enclosure of 5 x 5 m. Scent lures were used to attract bears in the hair-snag stations in order to increase the probability of ""capture"". Three types of scent lures were used: a mustelid lure in a pierced plastic bottle was hung in the air at the center of the station, while 100 mL of seal oil was applied to a wood pile in the middle of the station (on the ground), and a 1:1 mix of vegetable oil and anise oil was sprayed on tree trunks found within the barbwire section of the station. Lures were refreshed every week. Stations were sampled for 5 weeks, from 6 July to 18 August 2015, as black bears usually increase their movement rate at this time, increasing the probability of recapture and consequently yielding more precise density estimates. Stations were visited weekly and each hair sample was collected individually (i.e. multiple hairs tied on a single barb were considered one sample) and identified to record its location on the barbwire (lower vs. upper barbwire, and barb ID-#). After each visit, the barbwires were burned using a blowtorch to prevent DNA contamination between sessions. Each hair sample was stored in a paper envelope with silica desiccant and freeze-dried for 24 hours. All samples were sent to Wildlife Genetic International (hereafter WGI) for genotyping. Hair samples were subselected based on the ""Mowat 1-in-3"" method, developed by WGI ; this method offers a good compromise between genotyping many samples that belong to the same individual and missing genetic material from other individuals. DNA was extracted from the samples using QIAGEN DNeasy tissue kits, and the genotyping followed a standard three-phase approach (i.e. first pass, cleanup and error-check), using seven microsatellite markers (G10L, G10H, UarMU23, UarMU50, MSUT-2 and G10X) plus ZFX/ZFY for gender.</p>

<p>We used automated camera to estimate bear density with the Random Encounter Model. The encounter rate was assessed using 47 remote cameras (Spypoint model I-6: n = 13 and model Tiny: n = 22; Reconyx model RM45: n = 4; Moultrie model A-7i: n = 8). All cameras used passive infrared and movement sensors, and the trigger sensitivity was set to its maximum. The cameras were programmed to take three consecutive pictures when triggered, and were randomly distributed within the 7.5-km<sup>2</sup> sampling cells by generating 10 random points in each cell; one to five of these points were then selected based on their accessibility (on foot or with an ATV). The radius (r) of the camera detection zone was assessed through several trials during which a person crossed the camera detection zone perpendicularly. The detection arc (θ) of the camera detection zone was assumed to be the value found in the specifications of each camera model. At micro-site scale, the cameras were installed in a direction that provides a relatively clear detection zone, without being faced deliberately towards a trail used by wildlife. We removed branches and stems in front of the cameras to maintain consistency across cameras regarding the detection zone area and to reduce the number of empty pictures triggered by branch movements that trigger the sensors. At each selected point, a camera was fixed on a tree 75 cm aboveground for a minimum of 21 days, leading to the placement of 110 cameras from 1 July to 9 September 2015. The average speed (i.e. movement rate, measured as the Euclidian distance between two successive relocations divided by the time elapsed between them) was not available for the study population (Forillon), so we used GPS telemetry data gathered from four different black bear populations in the province of Québec during the last 19 years (see Table 1 for more details). For each dataset, we calculated average speed (v) and its standard error using only the relocations collected from July to September (i.e. the same period during which of our camera-trap and hair-snag data were collected) with a minimum fix-rate of 8 locations/day (i.e. 1 location every 3 hours) to reduce bias in the estimation of average speed.</p> <p>The use of camera traps in ecology helps affordably address questions about the distribution and density of cryptic and mobile species. The Random encounter model (REM) is a camera-trap method that has been developed to estimate population densities using unmarked individuals. However, few studies have evaluated its reliability in the field, especially considering that this method relies on parameters obtained from collared animals (<i>i.e.</i> average speed, in km/h), which can be difficult to acquire at low cost and effort. Our objectives were to (1) assess the reliability of this camera-trap method and (2) evaluate the influence of parameters coming from different populations on density estimates. We estimated a reference density of black bears (<i>Ursus americanus</i>) in Forillon National Park (Québec, Canada) using a spatial capture-recapture estimator based on hair-snag stations. We calculated average speed using telemetry data acquired from four different bear populations located outside our study area and estimated densities using the REM. The reference density, determined with a Bayesian spatial capture-recapture model, was 2.87 individuals/10km<sup>2</sup> [95% CI: 2.41–3.45], which was slightly lower (although not significatively different) than the different densities estimated using REM (ranging from 4.06–5.38 bears/10km<sup>2 </sup>depending on the average speed value used). Average speed values obtained from different populations had minor impacts on REM estimates when the difference in average speed between populations was low. Bias in speed values for slow-moving species had more influence on REM density estimates than for fast-moving species. We pointed out that a potential overestimation of density occurs when average speed is underestimated, i.e. using GPS telemetry locations with large fix-rate intervals. Our study suggests that REM could be an affordable alternative to conventional spatial capture-recapture, but highlights the need for further research to control for potential bias associated with speed values determined using GPS telemetry data.</p> <p>Funding provided by: Parks Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014612<br>Award Number: </p><p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: Discovery Grant #386661 to MH St-Laurent</p>","2022-04-23","7,8,0,3,6",NA,"yes","L","repository",".csv","sample coordinates","administrative unit","Map, site coordinates","Ursus americanus","2015","2015","2015","source link abstract",">1","not given","200","not given","presence-absence","NA","NA","Ecology and Evolution","NA","no","zenodo"

At each site, we placed a control detector 250-400m away from the treatment, enough distance to attenuate drone noise but remain in similar habitat. Upon arriving to one of our eight detection sites, we began the first phase of the trial by attaching the Echo Meter Touch 2 plugin acoustic bat detector (Wildlife Acoustics, Maynard, MA, USA) to a tablet and initiating recording with the corresponding Wildlife Acoustics app (Wildlife Acoustics, Maynard, MA, USA). Phase 1 consisted of audio recording from the ground with the Echo Meter Touch 2 for five minutes with no drone activity. After five minutes, we began Phase 2 by setting up one of three drones for the randomly chosen treatment. We either launched the drone to 15 m above the site of detection where the drone remained hovering; or we carried the drone to a launch site 50 m away, ascended it to 15 m above the launch site, and then flew the drone above the detection site. The drone hovered in place for five min, and afterwards was returned to its launch site. Once we powered off the drone, we continued to Phase 3, i.e. another five min of audio bat detection with no drone disturbance. This completed the trial, then we repeated the procedure at a new site, conducting one trial at each site every night of the experiment.

However, it remains unclear whether UAV disturbance deters animals, which would make this method inaccurate for data collection and hazardous to wildlife welfare. This study addresses the viability of UAV use for wildlife research by measuring the effects of UAV flight on acoustic bat detection and comparing bat activity in response to varying UAV models. Depending on the way UAVs effect bat detection rate, it may be possible to identify whether wildlife surveys should be done with UAVs and the drone models best suited for this purpose. The results reveal that larger and louder UAVs deterred significantly more bats, and the smallest and quietest model had no effect on bat detection. Indeed, drone noise was positively correlated with drone size, but drone size had little effect on the range of frequencies emitted. While detecting bats with small and quiet UAVs may be possible, complications still arise with acoustic detection and the species-specific effects of drone flight. The reliability of automatic identification with the acoustic detecting software is limited, as over a quarter of detections were triggered by non-bat noises yet still classified as bats (25.99%). Overall, using drones for wildlife detection should be approached with caution, as this study illustrates that some drones deter and disturb wild bats. If drones are used in wildlife habitat, consider flying smaller and quieter models, which are significantly less disturbing. Otherwise, large and loud drones will likely deter more animals and skew the results of the survey.</p> <p>Funding provided by: Kenneth Molson Foundation*<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: </p><p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: 241061</p>","2022-01-21","9,7,0,3,6","other","no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA","NA","NA","https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5831101","no","zenodo"

Production of adult emerald ash borer relies on flushing adults from logs which are subject to cold storage for some period prior to use. The effect of this storage on the number of insects emerging or the fitness of those that emerge has not been investigated. We subjected logs of EAB-infested white ash, Fraxinus americana L. to 7–14 month of cold storage and quantified the number of insects that emerged, time to emergence, and the body condition of adults as a measure of fitness. Body condition was evaluated using Soxhlet fat extraction and water weight. No published methods for Soxhlet fat extraction were available for this species so we developed extraction protocols. The number of insects emerging decreased with time, but fitness (i.e., fat content, water content) did not decrease. Time to emergence did increase but only in the longest-storage treatment while a comparison of male versus female emergence provides evidence for protandry in emerald ash borer. Rearing programs for emerald ash borer using wood from cold storage should adjust the amount used to produce a given number of insects but the quality of those individuals emerging will not be affected. We suggest that those insects that perished during storage were of lower quality when entering diapause and thus would serve as poor-quality host in rearing programs for natural enemies of emerald ash borer. These data also provide evidence for one pathway of introduction for emerald ash borer, suggesting that refrigeration in transit was required for EAB to remain viable and establish its beachhead in North America. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">DelayInEmergenceEABFitness_DataAnalyses<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data and R code to reproduce analyses and figures.

Connectivity can therefore shape trophic interactions, but little empirical evidence is available, especially for large mammals. In forest ecosystems, logging alters functional connectivity among habitat patches, and such activities can affect the spatial game between large herbivores and their predators. We used graph theory to evaluate how harvesting-induced changes in habitat connectivity influence patch choice and residency time of GPS-collared caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) and moose (Alces alces) in winter in the boreal forest. We then investigated the predator–prey game by assessing how GPS-collared wolves (Canis lupus) adjusted their movements to changes in landscape properties and in the networks of their prey species. We built prey habitat networks using minimum planar graphs organized around species-specific, highly selected habitat patches (i.e., network nodes). We found that spatial dynamics of large herbivores were influenced not only by the intrinsic quality of habitat patches, but also by the connectivity of those network nodes. Caribou and moose selected nodes that were connected by a high number of links, and moose also spent relatively more time in those nodes. By limiting node accessibility, human disturbances influenced travel decisions. Caribou and moose avoided nodes that were surrounded by a high proportion of cuts and roads, but once within these nodes, moose stayed longer than in other nodes. Caribou selectively moved among nodes with low distance costs, and their residency time increased with distance costs required to reach the nodes. Wolves selected their prey's nodes, where vegetation consumed by caribou and moose was highly abundant. Furthermore, wolves discriminated among those nodes by selecting the most connected ones. In fact, selection by wolves was stronger for their prey's nodes than for the prey's utilization distribution per se, a difference that increased with the level of human disturbance. Considering the difficulty of keeping track of highly mobile prey, predators may benefit by targeting not only their prey's resource patches, but also the most highly connected patches. Matrix quality and connectivity are therefore key elements shaping the predator–prey spatial game in human-altered landscapes because of their impact on the spatial dynamics of the interacting species. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Data for compositional analysis of caribou<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data used to characterize the land cover type of node of network for caribou.

Here, we investigate the genomic signatures of partial clonality in the deep water kelp <i>Laminaria rodriguezii</i>, known to reproduce by both sexual and asexual means. We compared these results with the species <i>Laminaria digitata</i>, a closely related species that differs by different traits, in particular its reproductive mode (no clonal reproduction). We analysed genome-wide variation with dd-RAD sequencing using 4077 SNPs in <i>L. rodriguezii</i> and 7364 SNPs in <i>L. digitata</i>. As predicted for partially clonal populations, we show that the distribution of F<sub>IS</sub> within populations of <i>L. rodriguezii</i> is shifted toward negative values, with a high number of loci showing heterozygote excess. This finding is the opposite of what we observed within sexual populations of <i>L. digitata</i>, characterized by a generalized deficit in heterozygotes. Furthermore, we observed distinct distributions of F<sub>IS</sub> among populations of <i>L. rodriguezii</i>, which is congruent with the predictions of theoretical models for different levels of clonality and genetic drift. These findings highlight that the empirical distribution of F<sub>IS</sub> is a promising feature for the genomic study of asexuality in natural populations. Our results also show that the populations of <i>L. rodriguezii</i> analysed here are genetically differentiated and probably isolated. Our study provides a conceptual framework to investigate partial clonality on the basis of RAD-sequencing SNPs. These results could be obtained without any reference genome, and are therefore of interest for various non-model species.</span></p> <p>Funding provided by: MARFOR*<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: Biodiversa/0004/2015</p><p>Funding provided by: European FEDER Fund*<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: 1166-39417</p><p>Funding provided by: Clonix2D*<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: ANR-18-CE32-0001</p><p>Funding provided by: MARFOR<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: Biodiversa/0004/2015</p><p>Funding provided by: European FEDER Fund<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: 1166-39417</p><p>Funding provided by: Clonix2D<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: ANR-18-CE32-0001</p>","2021-04-18","3,6","location","no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA","NA","NA","https://doi.org/https://github.com/LauricReynes","no","zenodo"

As patterns of structuring are products of historical and current demographics and gene flow, assessment of structure through time can yield an understanding of evolutionary dynamics acting on populations that are necessary to inform management. Recent dramatic population declines in hibernating bats in eastern North America from white-nose syndrome have prompted the need for information on movement dynamics for multiple bat species. We characterized population genetic structure of the little brown bat, Myotis lucifugus, at swarming sites in southeastern Canada using 9 nuclear microsatellites and a 292-bp region of the mitochondrial genome. Analyses of FST, ΦST, and Bayesian clustering (STRUCTURE) found weak levels of genetic structure among swarming sites for the nuclear and mitochondrial genome (Global FST = 0.001, P &lt; 0.05, Global ΦST = 0.045, P &lt; 0.01, STRUCTURE K = 1) suggesting high contemporary gene flow. Hierarchical AMOVA also suggests little structuring at a regional (provincial) level. Metrics of nuclear genetic structure were not found to differ between males and females suggesting weak asymmetries in gene flow between the sexes. However, a greater degree of mitochondrial structuring does support male-biased dispersal long term. Demographic analyses were consistent with past population growth and suggest a population expansion occurred from approximately 1250 to 12,500 BP, following Pleistocene deglaciation in the region. Our study suggests high gene flow and thus a high degree of connectivity among bats that visit swarming sites whereby mainland areas of the region may be best considered as one large gene pool for management and conservation. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">MYLU microsatellite data<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Microsatellite loci data as coded as an input file for GENEPOP</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">MYLU_microsatellites_GENEPOP.txt<br></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">MYLU mtDNA Arlequin infile<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Mitchondrial haplotypes of the Hypervariable II area of the control region for Myotis lucifugus.

If a species is locally adapted at its range margin it could be beneficial for range expansion as it ensures that the genotypes colonizing new areas are the fittest because environmental conditions are more similar to the current ones. In trees, local adaptation can slow range expansion when climate change happens much faster than their ability to migrate. We investigate experimentally a series of factors thought to constrain the seedling phase at the leading edge of the distribution of a dominant tree species, sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marshall.). We established a seed transplant experiment using six provenances, representing the latitudinal species range, and transplanted them to 12 sites within, at, and beyond the current northern species range margin. Northern provenances currently provide the best opportunity for establishment beyond the actual range, where climatic conditions are more similar than those of the warmer central or southern portions of the species range. While establishment was highest within the species range, survival rates were comparable to those at the range margin and beyond, regardless of provenance. We also find that the local climate is the most influential factor for early seedling establishment and survival; however, a lack of suitable microsites also significantly constrained recruitment. Our study highlights the complex interaction between provenance, climate, and microsite conditions that are required to ensure successful seedling recruitment. While sugar maple is currently displaying evidence for local adaptation to facilitate range shifts, it could risk maladaptation in the future if the local climate warms beyond threshold required to ensure seed germination and a lack of favourable microsite conditions beyond the range. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">plot<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">This .csv file includes the raw data for the plot level assessment.

<h4><em>Species selection, seed material and precultivation</em></h4>

<p>The species used are herbaceous angiosperms occurring in the grassland plots of the German ""Biodiversity Exploratories"" (Fischer et al. 2010; Socher et al. 2012). In each of three regions of Germany, the Schwäbische-Alb (south-western Germany), Hainich-Dün (central Germany), and Schorfheide-Chorin (north-eastern Germany), 50 plots (4 m × 4 m) were selected in grassland habitats covering a wide range of land-use intensities. From 2008 to 2016, the vegetation composition of each of the 150 plots was assessed annually in late spring by estimating the cover of each species. We standardized the species names according to the accepted names in  <a href=""http://www.theplantlist.org/"">http://www.theplantlist.org</a>, accessed on 15<sup>th</sup> June 2019, using the <i>Taxonstand</i> package (Cayuela et al. 2012) to allow us to align the species names between different distribution and trait datasets (see below). In total, 363 vascular plant species have been identified in the plots of the ""Biodiversity Exploratories"". For 311 of those species, we were able to obtain seeds from commercial seed suppliers or botanical gardens for our experiments (see Appendix S1 in Supporting Information). For <i>Alchemilla vulgaris agg.</i>, which also includes taxa that are difficult to distinguish from <i>A. vulgaris</i>, we used seeds from <i>A. vulgaris</i>. For <i>Leucanthemum vulgare agg.</i>, which includes both <i>L. vulgare</i> and <i>L. ircutianum</i>, we used seeds from both species and the trait values were averaged.</p>

<p>In two experiments, we measured functional traits on those species. Before the first experiment, we individually weighed 10 seeds, randomly chosen from the supplier's bag, for each of the 311 species. Then we did an indoor pot experiment to determine root morphology of the species, and an outdoor pot experiment to determine rooting depth. For both experiments, seeds were first sown in plastic pots (7 cm × 7 cm × 6.5 cm) filled with peat soil. The pots were then placed in a growth chamber for two to three weeks (night/day 9/15 h; 18/21 ± 1.5°C; relative humidity 90 ± 5%) before transplanting the seedlings into the pots used for the experiments (for cultivation times, see Appendix S1). In addition to the traits measured in the experiments, we obtained data on aboveground traits (specific leaf area, height), bud-bank size and mycorrhizal status from databases (see the section ""Traits from databases and data imputation"" below).</p>

<h4><em>Experiment on root-system morphology</em></h4>

<p>From May 1 to October 6, 2017, we performed a glasshouse experiment to measure root-system morphological traits of the study species. As root morphology might depend on nutrient availability, we grew half of the plants per species at intermediate nutrient levels and the other half at high nutrient levels, after which we averaged the trait values per species. Because of the large number of species and the time-consuming measurements, we grew the plants in four temporally shifted (4-6 weeks) batches. We aimed to have each species represented in each batch, and to have a total of seven replicates per species and nutrient level across all batches (Appendix S1). The seedlings of the species that had germinated (N=233) were transplanted individually into plastic pots (1.3 L) filled with a mixture of sand and vermiculite (1:1 volume ratio). The pots were then randomly allocated to positions in two glasshouse compartments, and allowed to grow for four weeks (night/day 10/14 h; 22/28 ± 1.5°C; relative humidity 80 ± 15%). Plants were fertilized three times a week with either an intermediate nutrient solution (40 ml with 1500 µM KNO<sub>3</sub>) or a high nutrient solution (40 ml with 12000 µM KNO<sub>3</sub>). The fertilizer was a modified version of the Hoagland recipe (see Appendix S2).</p>

<p>We grew the plants for four weeks only to avoid roots becoming pot-bound, to be able to analyse the entire root systems, and to ensure that all the belowground biomass was formed by roots, excluding rhizomes. After washing off the substrate, the root system was cut below the collar and stored for &lt;1 week in a plastic tube filled with distilled water at 4°C. Then, root systems were spread individually in a thin layer of water in transparent trays (11 cm × 11 cm) and scanned at 800 dpi with a flatbed scanner modified for root scanning (Epson Expression 10000 XL and 11000 XL). The images were analysed using the software WinRHIZO<sup>TM </sup>2017a (Regent Instruments, Quebec, Canada) to obtain the total root length and root volume. Root systems were then oven-dried for &gt;48 hours at 65°C and weighed. We calculated specific root length by dividing the total root length by the belowground dry biomass, and root tissue density by dividing the belowground dry biomass by the sum of the root volumes according to Rose (2017). The diameter of fine roots (i.e. distal roots), thought to be the most important roots for nutrient uptake (Freschet and Roumet 2017), was determined by randomly sampling a distal root branch (or a portion of it) for each root system and calculating the mean of the external-internal links diameter obtained with the ""Link analysis"" function in WinRHIZO<sup>TM</sup>. This subsampling avoided the inclusion of thicker transport roots and allowed us to obtain values that were representative for first order roots. We also dried and weighed the aboveground biomass of each plant, and calculated the root weight ratio (i.e. root biomass divided by total biomass).</p>

<h4><em>Experiment on rooting depth</em></h4>

<p>From the 15<sup>th</sup> of May to the 10<sup>th</sup> of October 2018, we performed an outdoor pot experiment to measure the maximum rooting depth of the species. Up to five seedlings of the species that had germinated (n=196; Appendix S1) were transplanted individually into 120 cm tall plastic tree shelter tubes (Tubex ® Standard Plus, <a href=""http://www.tubex.com/products/tree-shelters/tubex-standard-treeshelters/specification.php"">http://www.tubex.com/products/tree-shelters/tubex-standard-treeshelters/specification.php</a>), which are normally used in forestry to protect young trees against animals and the elements. We closed the bottoms of these tubes with thick pieces of cotton tissue to be able to use them as pots. The tubes were filled with a mixture of sand and vermiculite (1:1 volume ratio) up to a height of 115 cm. This substrate can be easily penetrated by the roots, and therefore allows each plant to reach its maximum rooting depth quickly. The tree shelter tubes were delivered in packages of five tubes stacked into each other, and they therefore came in five diameter classes (8.0, 8.4, 10.0, 10.8 and 12.0 cm). To avoid that tube diameter would be confounded with species identity, each of the five seedlings per species was planted in a different tube-diameter class. We placed the tubes upright in a randomized design in the Botanical Garden of the University of Konstanz (47°41'24.0""N 9°10'48.0""E; see Appendix S11 for pictures).</p>

<p>We planted 734 plants but, due to early mortality, we had to replace 126 of them within the next three weeks. The growth period therefore ranged from 16 to 19 weeks. The experiment took place during the summer of 2018 (mean temperature: 19.5°C, min/max 2.5/37.4°C; relative humidity: mean 74%, min/max 22.7/100%). All plants were fertilized once a week with 60 ml of a standard nutrient solution (1‰ Universol<sup>® </sup>Blue, Nordhorn, Germany), and watered regularly from above. We harvested the plants in October 2018. Each tube was sliced open, and we measured the distance from the top of the substrate to the deepest root.</p>

<h4><em>Traits from databases and data imputation</em></h4>

<p>Data on the aboveground traits specific leaf area (230 species) and height (228 species) were obtained from the LEDA database (Kleyer et al. 2008). Data on bud-bank size (230 species) including stem and root-derived buds occurring belowground or at the soil surface was obtained from Klimešová et al. (2017). In addition, mycorrhizal status was extracted from the FungalRoot database (Soudzilovskaia et al. 2020). We assigned the corresponding genus-level mycorrhizal status for each of our species (241 species) included in the analysis. Though most of our species are considered either obligatorily arbuscular-mycorrhizal (167 species), facultatively arbuscular-mycorrhizal (57 species) or non-mycorrhizal (16 species), <i>Helianthemum nummularium</i> is considered ectomycorrhizal. Therefore, it was grouped with the obligatorily arbuscular-mycorrhizal species to form the obligate-mycorrhizal category (168 species).</p>

<p>Although for each of the traits we had data for 196 (rooting depth) to 311 (seed weight) species, the number of species with complete data for all traits was 170. Therefore, we did phylogenetically informed imputation of missing data for the 241 species that germinated and survived until trait measurement in at least one of our two experiments. Data imputation is a powerful but still underutilized tool that increases sample size —and thus statistical power— and reduces potential biases that might occur if the species with missing data are a non-random subset (Nakagawa 2015). Imputation can perform well with up to 50% of missing data (Graham 2009). In our case, 4.6% of the trait values were missing and had to be imputed (see Appendix S4 for details on the imputation procedure). We also ran all analyses for the subset of 170 species with complete data (i.e. without imputed data), and the results were largely similar to the analyses of the 241 species with partly imputed data (Appendix S9). Because the analyses with the imputed data allowed us to include more species (i.e. increase statistical power and generality), we present only those results in the main text. The phylogenetic tree of the species used, their standardized trait values and phylogenetic signal can be found in Appendix S5, S6 and S7.</p>

<h3>Species abundance and occurrence frequency</h3>

<p>To quantify each species' commonness from local scale abundance to global naturalization success, we used four different data sources.</p>

<h4><em>The Biodiversity Exploratories</em></h4>

<p>To obtain information on local abundance and occurrence frequency of our study species in German grasslands, we used data from the Biodiversity Exploratories grassland-composition surveys. In each of the three regions, c. 500 so-called grid plots (GPs) and a subset of those, the 50 so-called experimental plots (EPs), have been monitored for biodiversity measures. The plots are 50 m × 50 m, and in each of those there is a subplot of 4 m × 4 m, in which the relative abundance of each plant species has been determined. In the 1494 GPs, vegetation was sampled once from 25 May to 15 August 2007. In May 2009, 138 plots were re-assessed and earlier relevés were discarded, because they were considered unreliable as the vegetation had been recorded too late in the season of 2007 (Socher et al. 2013). Of our 241 study species, 213 were present in that census of the GPs (Appendix S1), and, when present in a plot, they covered on average 2.8% of the plot (min: 0.27%; median: 1.45%; max. 17.16%). For the 150 EPs, the vegetation data were collected annually between mid-May and mid-June from 2008 to 2016, and we averaged the data across years. Of our 241 study species, 239 were present in the EPs vegetation survey, and, when present in a plot, they covered on average 1.05% of the plot (min.: 0.01%; median: 0.34%; max.: 13.05%). Two study species, <i>Spergula arvensis</i> and <i>Taraxacum campylodes</i>, had been excluded because their names were included in an earlier version of the vegetation survey due to misidentification. While there are 10 times more GPs than EPs, the latter include data over a longer period. For both the GPs and EPs, we used two distribution metrics for each species: the occurrence frequency defined as the number of plots in which a species is present divided by the total number of plots, and the local abundance defined as the mean cover of a species across all the plots where it is present. Because it is based on the presence-absence only, the occurrence frequency estimates how frequent a species is within grasslands in Germany. The average abundance, on the other hand, which is calculated using abundance data for only those plots where the species occurs, estimates how dense the populations of the species are on average.</p>

<h4><em>FloraWeb</em></h4>

<p>For information on the occurrence frequency in all of Germany, irrespective of habitat type, we obtained data from the German plant distribution atlas of NetPhyD and BfN through the FloraWeb data portal (Bundesamt für Naturschutz 2013). For each species, we extracted the number of grid cells in which the species has been reported. Each grid cell is about 130 km², and there are 2995 grid cells in total. Of our 241 study species, 235 had grid-cell data available (Appendix S1).</p>

<h4><em>Euro+Med PlantBase</em></h4>

<p>To obtain information on the extent of the native distribution in all of Europe and its adjacent Mediterranean regions, we used Euro+Med PlantBase (PESI 2015). This on-line database provides information on the presence of vascular plant taxa in 117 regions (mostly countries) covering all of Europe and the Mediterranean regions of North Africa and the Near East. Of our 241 study species, 237 species were found in Euro+Med PlantBase, and for those we extracted the total number of regions with native occurrences (Appendix S1). The four remaining species, <i>Cerastium nutans</i>, <i>Erigeron canadensis</i>, <i>Matricaria discoidea</i> and <i>Medicago × varia</i>, are not native to the region.</p>

<h4><em>GloNAF</em></h4>

<p>As 237 of our 241 study species are native to Europe, we also assessed the extent of their global occurrence as naturalized alien species, using the Global Naturalized Alien Flora (GloNAF) database, version 1.2 (van Kleunen et al. 2019). GloNAF is a compendium of lists of naturalized alien plant species for 1029 regions covering &gt;80% of the terrestrial ice-free surface. Of our 241 study species, 221 species had at least one record in GloNAF. For those species, we extracted the number of regions in which they are naturalized, and for the 20 species without GloNAF records, we set the number of GloNAF regions equal to zero.</p>

<h3>Statistical analyses</h3>

<p>All statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.6.1 (R Core Team 2019). To test whether more abundant and more widespread species have particular trait values, we used generalized linear models in which the response variables were the different measures of species commonness and the predictors were a selection of trait mean values. For number of occurrences in GloNAF regions, and in grassland GPs and EPs, we used negative binomial error distributions (with a log-link function). As the number of occurrences in FloraWeb grid cells and Euro+Med regions did not follow negative binomial or Poisson error distributions, we instead analysed the proportion of FloraWeb grid cells and Euro+Med regions in which a species had been recorded, with a binomial error distribution. To account for overdispersion, we used the 'quasibinomial' setting. For analyses of the mean local abundance (i.e. the cover proportion) of the species in the GPs and EPs, we used a gamma conditional distribution (with log-link function).</p>

<p>For each commonness measure, we used a multivariate model with ten traits as predictors. We <i>a priori</i> chose traits that represent different aspects of plant functioning and that had relatively low pairwise correlations (all r ≤ |0.49|, Appendix S3) to minimize multicolinearity (the maximum generalized variance-inflation factor of a model was 3.32). We used the following traits: individual seed weight (measured on seeds ordered for the experiments), specific root length, root tissue density and fine roots diameter (measured in the root-system morphology experiment), maximum rooting depth (measured in the rooting-depth experiment), and bud-bank size, height, specific leaf area and mycorrhizal status (from trait databases). Seed weight was log transformed. To facilitate interpretation of and comparison between model coefficients, each trait was scaled to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one (Schielzeth 2010). To test for potential non-linear effects of traits, orthogonal polynomial terms of second degree (i.e. quadratic terms) were also included for each trait, using the <i>poly</i> function. To estimate the proportion of variance explained by the models, we calculated delta R² values, applicable to all distributions and link functions, according to Nakagawa et al. (2017) using the package MuMIn (Barton and Barton 2015). To assess whether belowground traits explained more variance in commonness measures than aboveground traits, we also extracted delta R² values for models using only the three aboveground predictors and for models using only the three belowground predictors with the highest standardized coefficients. To account for phylogenetic non-independence of the study species, the models were also run using phylogenetic relatedness of species as a variance-covariance matrix (for details, see Appendix S4). Although the significances of the trait effects differed in some instances between the non-phylogenetic models and the phylogenetic ones, the directions of the effects were largely the same in both types of models (compare Fig. 1 and Appendix S8). Therefore, we only present the results of the non-phylogenetic analyses in the main text.</p>

Plants vary widely in how common or rare they are, but whether commonness of species is associated with functional traits is still debated. This might partly be because commonness can be measured at different spatial scales, and because most studies focus solely on aboveground functional traits.</p>

<p>2. We measured five root traits and seed mass on 241 Central European grassland species, and extracted their specific leaf area, height, mycorrhizal status and bud-bank size from databases. Then we tested if trait values are associated with commonness at seven spatial scales, ranging from abundance in 16-m² grassland plots, via regional and European-wide occurrence frequencies, to worldwide naturalization success.</p>

<p>3. At every spatial scale, commonness was associated with at least three traits. The traits explained the greatest proportions of variance for abundance in grassland plots (42%) and naturalization success (41%), and the least for occurrence frequencies in Europe and the Mediterranean (2%). Low root tissue density characterized common species at every scale, whereas other traits showed directional changes depending on the scale. We also found that many of the effects had significant non-linear effects, in most cases with the highest commonness-metric value at intermediate trait values. Across scales, belowground traits explained overall more variance in species commonness (19.4%) than aboveground traits (12.6%).</p>

<p>4. The changes we found in the relationships between traits and commonness, when going from one spatial scale to another, could at least partly explain the maintenance of trait variation in nature. Most importantly, our study shows that within grasslands, belowground traits are at least as important as aboveground traits for species commonness. Therefore, belowground traits should be more frequently considered in studies on plant functional ecology.</p> <p>Please find complementarity information about the dataset in the Supplementary Information of the corresponding article.</p>

<p>The capture histories were derived from the capture-mark-recapture (and recovery) data presented in the main text of the manuscript linked to this dataset. The dataset was thoroughly inspected and checked for errors (e.g. birds observed before they were marked or observations made after the ring of a dead bird was reported), and histories containing errors (~200 histories) were removed.</p>

<p>Dataset B: Annual Greater Snow Goose Harvest Rate</p>
<p>This file contains the standardized yearly harvest rate of greater snow geese in Canada and the USA between 1990 and 2018. This data was processed following the procedures described in Appendix 2 of the manuscript linked to this dataset.</p>
<p>The data file is formatted to be read by program E-SURGE [Gemaco -&gt; File with external variables]. The first line contains one number indicating the number of covariates present in the file. The second line contains the number of occasions for which a temporal covariate is used (must match the number of capture occasions - 1). The third line is the standardized yearly harvest rate used in the analyses calculating hunting and non-hunting mortality.</p> <p>Non-additive effects from multiple interacting stressors can have unpredictable outcomes on wildlife. Stressors that initially have negligible impacts may become significant if they act in synergy with novel stressors. Wildlife markers can be a source of physiological stress for animals and are ubiquitous in ecological studies. Their potential impacts on vital rates may vary over time, particularly when changing environments impose new stressors.</p>
<p>In this study, we evaluated the temporal changes in the combined impact of two stressors, one constant (collar-marking) and another one variable over time (hunting intensity), in greater snow geese (Anser caerulescens atlantica). Over a 30-year period (1990-2019), hunting regulations were liberalized twice, in 1999 and 2009, with the instauration of special spring and winter hunting seasons, respectively. We evaluated the effect of collars on goose survival through this period of changing hunting regulations. We compared annual survival of &gt;20,000 adult females marked with and without neck collars using multievent capture-recapture models, and partitioned hunting from non-hunting mortality.</p>
<p>Survival of geese marked with or without collars was similar in 1990-1998, before hunting regulations were liberalized (average survival[95% C.I.]: 0.87[0.84, 0.89]). However, absolute survival of collared geese was 0.05[0.03, 0.07] lower than that of non-collared geese between 1999 and 2009, and 0.12[0.09, 0.15] lower after hunting regulations were liberalized further in 2009. Hunting and non-hunting mortality were both higher in collared birds compared to those without collars.</p>
<p>The interaction between the effects of collars and hunting was synergistic because collars affected survival only after the hunting pressure increased significantly. These cumulated stresses probably reduced goose body condition sufficiently to increase their vulnerability to multiple sources of mortality.</p>
<p>Synthesis and applications: Researchers relying on long-term marking programs should evaluate the effect of markers periodically rather than solely in the beginning, as interactions with changing environmental conditions may eventually affect conclusions of studies based on marked animals. Here, we provide a rare demonstration in a natural setting that a combination of stressors can push animals beyond a threshold where vital rates are affected, even when one stressor applied alone initially had no detectable impact.</p> <p>All data files can be read using program E-SURGE (Choquet, Rouan et al. 2009).

"96",96,"https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.jk680","Data from: Investigating genomic and phenotypic parallelism between piscivorous and planktivorous lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) ecotypes by means of RADseq and morphometrics analyses","Data from: Investigating genomic and phenotypic parallelism between piscivorous and planktivorous lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) ecotypes by means of RADseq and morphometrics analyses  Repeated adaptive ecological diversification has commonly been reported in fish and has often been associated with trophic niche diversity. The main goal of this study was to investigate the extent of parallelism in the genomic and phenotypic divergence between piscivorous and planktivorous lake trout ecotypes from Laurentian Shield lakes, Canada. This was achieved by documenting the extent of morphological differentiation using geometric morphometrics and linear measurements as well as the pattern of genomic divergence by means of RADseq genotyping (3925 filtered SNPs) in 12 lakes. Our results indicate that the two ecotypes evolved distinct body shape and several linear measurements in parallel. Neutral genetic differentiation was pronounced between all isolated populations (Mean FST = 0.433), indicating no or very limited migration and pronounced genetic drift. Significant genetic differentiation also suggested partial reproductive isolation between ecotypes in the two lakes where they are found in sympatry. Combining different outlier detection methods, we identified 48 SNPs putatively under divergent selection between ecotypes, among which 10 could be annotated and related to functions such as developmental processes and ionic regulation. Finally, our results indicate that parallel morphological divergence is accompanied by both parallel and nonparallel genomic divergence, which is associated with the use of different trophic niches between ecotypes. The results are also discussed in the context of management and conservation of this highly exploited species throughout northern North America. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">genepop_all_snps<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Genotypes data (all loci) for S. namaycush individuals in Genepop format.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">genepop_pot_selected_snps<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Genotypes data (48 potentially selected loci, intersection of Bayenv2 and LFMM results) for S. namaycush individuals in Genepop format.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">population_map<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Individual's population membership (by population (or lake) or sympatric ecotype).</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">population_map_ecotype<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Individual's ecotype membership (by population (or lake) or sympatric ecotype).</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">geometric_morphometrics<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Geometric morphometrics data in TPS format.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">infos_tps<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Information (ecotype and sex) for geometric morphometrics analyses.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">measurements<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Gill rakers and linear measurements data.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">ReadMe<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Information about the files.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">read_me.txt<br></div></div> Genomics/Proteomics; Conservation Biology Canada; Quebec","2016-08-05","3,6",NA,"yes","M","repository",".txt","not given","geological feature me","Map, geological feature me","Salvelinus namaycush","2007-2013","2007","2013","source publication text","6","not given","not given","NA","EBV genetic analysis","NA","NA","Molecular Ecology","https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.13795","no","dryad"

Exome-capture pool-seq (20 diploid individuals), individually sequenced (the same diploid individuals in pools), and haploid megagametophyte data from a single individual was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq4000 instrument at Centre d'expertise et de services Génome Québec, Montréal, Canada.

Due in part to multiple ancient whole genome duplication events, gene family expansion and subsequent evolution within <i>Pinaceae</i>, false diversity from the misalignment of paralog copies creates further challenges in accurately and reproducibly inferring evolutionary history from sequence data. Here, we leverage the cost-saving benefits of pool-seq and exome-capture to discover SNPs in two conifer species, Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> var. <i>menziesii </i>(Mirb.) Franco, <i>Pinaceae</i>) and jack pine (<i>Pinus banksiana</i> Lamb., <i>Pinaceae</i>). We show, using minimal baseline filtering, that allele frequencies estimated from pooled individuals show a strong positive correlation with those estimated by sequencing the same population as individuals (r &gt; 0.948), on par with such comparisons made in model organisms. Further, we highlight the utility of haploid megagametophyte tissue for identifying sites that are likely due to misaligned paralogs. Together with additional minor filtering, we show that it is possible to remove many of the loci with large frequency estimate discrepancies between individual and pooled sequencing approaches, improving the correlation further (r &gt; 0.973). Our work addresses bioinformatic challenges in non-model organisms with large and complex genomes, highlights the use of megagametophyte tissue for the identification of paralog sites, and suggests the combination of pool-seq and exome capture to be robust for further evolutionary hypothesis testing in these systems.</p> <p>All code to analyze these files is also attached.<br>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">We created a geodatabase of 10 ha hexagons for the region in order to summarize the spatial data in this study into spatial units that are comparable across the region but that also represent an area size that is relevant for site-level plans such as landscape connectivity or forest conservation.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The hexagon geodatabase covers 28,269 km<sup>2</sup> in within the 5 watersheds in northern California, and 40,895 km<sup>2</sup> in the 5 watersheds plus a 10 km buffer area.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Integrating data into the hexes</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Data from a variety of grid scales, including 10, 30, 90, and 270m was added using the ArcGIS sample tool with the Hexagon centroids to sample the 270m resolution data, and the zonal statistics tool within Hexagon boundaries for raster data with smaller grid cell sizes.</p>

<ul>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Air temperature &amp; topographic – Topographic data was used to calculate microrefugia buffering capacity for each hexagon.

<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong><u>Microrefugia – thermal buffering capacity</u></strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Thermal buffering capacity combined two metrics that represent potential modifications to the air temperature in each 10-ha hexagon. First, a 10m digital elevation model was used to calculate the variation in air temperature within each hexagon due to variations in elevation, using a standard environmental lapse rate. Second, the influence of solar radiation on air temperature was calculated. These two metrics were combined.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Elevational Effect on Air Temperature   Column: ElevLR_NegEff2</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Zonal Statistics was performed on a 10m DEM for each hex. The range of elevation was used with environmental lapse rate to calculate ""buffering capacity"" within each Hexagon. We used an environmental lapse rate of 0.00649606 C⁰/ meter (International Civil Aviation Organization, 1993) to calculate the range of temperatures within the hexagon. To calculate the effect of elevation on air temperature within each hexagon we used the following equation: (Average Elevation – Maximum Elevation) x 0.00649606</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Solar Radiation Effect on Air Temperature: – Column: SRtemp_min</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We ran the analysis on a 25 m-resolution DEM. We calculated annualized solar radiation via the r.sun model available in GRASS 7.8 (https://grass.osgeo.org/grass70/manuals/r.sun.html) which calculates direct, diffuse, and reflected solar irradiation for a given day, location, topography, and atmospheric conditions. We assumed clear-sky conditions to run this model, and ran the model for 2 days in each month, from which we calculated solar radiation as a yearly total in watt-hours/m<sup>2</sup>. We converted the output to megajoules as follows.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">We used a regionally calibrated conversion factor to determine air temperature from Watts/M<sup>2</sup>/time from a study in the Sierra Nevada Mountains (Curtis et al.; Flint et al. 2021), who determined the relationship of solar radiation with air temperature by using snowmelt and air temperature measurements in the field, which were then used to calibrate a solar radiation model for topographically diverse locations (Flint and Childs, 1987). The best fit resulted in an increase of 0.25 C for every 2.5 MJ/day of solar radiation above 7.5 MJ/day (Table below). Zonal Statistics was performed for each hexagon and the minimum value of solar radiation-driven air temperature was retained.</p>

For example, pollinator abundance might decrease at range limits due to harsh environmental conditions, and reduced plant density can reduce attractiveness to pollinators and increase or decrease herbivory. We tested for variation in the strength of pollen limitation and herbivory by ungulates along a gradient leading to the upper elevational range limits of Trillium erectum (Melanthiaceae) and Erythronium americanum (Liliaceae) in Mont-Mégantic National Park, Québec, Canada. In T. erectum, pollen limitation was higher at the range limit, but seed set decreased only slightly with elevation and only in one of two years. In contrast, herbivory of T. erectum increased from &lt;10% at low elevations to &gt;60% at the upper elevational range limit. In E. americanum, we found no evidence of pollen limitation despite a significant decrease in seed set with elevation, and herbivory was low across the entire gradient. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential for relatively strong negative interactions (herbivory) and weak positive interactions (pollination) at plant range edges, although this was clearly species-specific. To the extent that these interactions have important demographic consequences – highly likely for herbivory on Trillium, based on previous studies – such interactions might play a role in determining plant species' range limits along putatively climatic gradients. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Trillium_erectum_Pollen_Limitation_2016<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Reproductive success and leaf size of Trillium erectum for control and pollen supplemented individuals along an elevation gradient at Mont-Mégantic National Park.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">trillium_erectum_PL_2016.xlsx<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Erythronium_americanum_Pollen_Limiation_2016<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Reproductive success and leaf size of Erythronium americanum for control and pollen supplemented individuals along an elevation gradient at Mont-Mégantic National Park.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">erythronium_americanum_PL_2016.xlsx<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Trillium_erectum_herbivory_2016<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Proportion of browsed Trillium erectum individuals along an elevation gradient at Mont-Mégantic National Park.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">trillium_erectum_herbivorie_2016.xlsx<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Erythronium_americanum_herbivory_2016<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Proportion of browsed Erythronium americanum individuals along an elevation gradient at Mont-Mégantic National Park.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">erythronium_americanum_herbivorie_2016.xlsx<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Number_of_seeds_T.erectum_E.americanum_2015_2016<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Reproductive success of Trillium erectum and Erythronium americanum along an elevation gradient at Mont-Mégantic National Park.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">nombre_de_graines_contrôles_T.erectum_E.americanum_2015_2016.xlsx<br></div></div> range limit; Trillium erectum; Erythronium americanum; reproductive success; pollen limitation Mont-Mégantic National Park","2018-08-10","3,4",NA,"yes","L","repository",".xlsx","not given","administrative unit","site coordinates","Trillium erectum, Erythronium americanum","2015-2016","2015","2016","source publication text","1","not given","55","source publication text","presence only","NA","NA","Ecology and Evolution","https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.3397","no","zenodo"

The archived data have the same units as reported in the corresponding article.</p> <p>1. As soils store more carbon (C) than the Earth's atmosphere and terrestrial biomass together, the balance between soil C uptake in the form of soil organic matter and release as CO2 upon its decomposition is a critical determinant in the global C cycle regulating our planet's climate. Although plant litter is the predominant source of C fueling both soil C build-up and losses, the issue of how litter chemistry influences this balance remains unresolved.</p>
<p>2. As a contribution to solving that issue, we traced the fate of C during near-complete decomposition of 13C-labelled leaf and root litters from 12 plant species in a coarse-textured soil. We separated the soil organic carbon (SOC) into mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) and particulate organic matter (POM) pools, and investigated how 14 litter chemical traits affected novel SOC formation and native SOC mineralization (i.e., the priming effect) in these soil fractions.</p>
<p>3. We observed an overall net increase in SOC due to the addition of litter, which was stronger for root than for leaf litters. The presumed stable MAOM-C pool underwent both substantial stabilization and mineralization, whereas the presumably less stable POM-C pool showed substantial stabilization and reduced mineralization. Overall, the initial increase in soil C mineralization was fully counterbalanced by a later decrease in native soil C mineralization. POM-C formation as well as MAOM-C formation and mineralization were positively related to the initial litter lignin concentration and negatively to that of the nitrogen leachates, whereas the opposite was observed for POM-C mineralization.</p>
<p>4. Synthesis. Our results highlight the importance of litter chemical traits for SOC formation, and stabilization, destabilization, and mineralization. In our coarse-textured soil, the amount of MAOM-C did not change despite large C fluxes through this pool. The litter chemical traits that drove these processes differed from those frequently reported for fine-textured soils far from mineral-associated C saturation. To account for these discrepancies, we propose an integrative perspective in which litter quality and soil texture interactively control soil C fluxes by modulating several SOC stabilization and destabilization mechanisms. Irrespective, our results open new critical perspectives for managing soil C pools globally.</p> <p>The data are archieved as a .csv text file.</p><p>Funding provided by: EC2CO*<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: </p><p>Funding provided by: Fondation de l'Université du Québec en Abitibi-Témiscamingue<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004098<br>Award Number: </p><p>Funding provided by: Laboratoires d'Excellences*<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: ANR-10-LABX-41</p><p>Funding provided by: NSERC Discovery*<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: </p> Ecosystem function and services; carbon cycle; plant litter; decomposition; soil organic matter; Priming effect; soil carbon storage","2022-10-05","3,9","other","no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","no","zenodo"

In birds, and especially for migratory species, assessing these rates is challenging because of the difficulties involved in tracking individuals beyond fledging. Here we assessed the determinants of nest box local recruitment and natal dispersal distances in a declining aerial insectivore, the Tree swallow (<em>Tachycineta bicolor</em>). We used a 16-year dataset obtained from the long-term monitoring of a population breeding within a 10,200-km<sup>2</sup> study system located along a gradient of agricultural intensification in southern Québec, Canada. Yearly nest box local recruitment rates ranged there in between 1.0% and 3.2%. Heavier nestlings who fledged earlier were more likely to recruit. Natal dispersal distances were generally short (mean ± SD = 12.7 ± 13.8 km) in the study system and were influenced by different factors depending on sex. Females dispersed over shorter distances when conspecific occupancy on breeding site was high, while males dispersed farther in the presence of competing House sparrows (<em>Passer domesticus</em>) and when their mother was young. Selection of breeding locations appeared to take place at multiple scales and individuals recruited in sites with characteristics similar to their natal sites. Our results provide important information concerning the factors influencing nest box local recruitment and natal dispersal dynamics of this migratory species.

We investigated how woodland caribou, a threatened species inhabiting North-American boreal forests, modified their fine-scale movements when confronted with forest management features (i.e. clearcuts and roads). We used GPS telemetry data collected between 2004 and 2010 on 49 female caribou in a managed area in Québec, Canada. Movements were studied using a use – availability design contrasting observed steps (i.e. line connecting two consecutive locations) with random steps (i.e. proxy of immediate habitat availability). Although caribou mostly avoided disturbances, individuals nonetheless modulated their fine-scale response to disturbances on a daily and annual basis, potentially compromising between risk avoidance in periods of higher vulnerability (i.e. calving, early and late winter) during the day and foraging activities in periods of higher energy requirements (i.e. spring, summer and rut) during dusk/dawn and at night. The local context in which females moved was shown to influence their decision to cross clearcut edges and roads. Indeed, although females typically avoided crossing clearcut edges and roads at low densities, crossing rates were found to rapidly increase in greater disturbance densities. In some instance, however, females were less likely to cross edges and roads as densities increased. Females may then be trapped and forced to use disturbed habitats, known to be associated with higher predation risk. We believe that further increases in anthropogenic disturbances could exacerbate such behavioural responses and ultimately lead to population level consequences. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Beauchesne Jaeger and St-Laurent_PLoS ONE datasets<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Characteristics of observed and random steps of female Woodland caribou inhabiting a highly disturbed landscape in eastern Canada.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Beauchesne et al_datasets PLoS ONE.zip<br></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div> Cumulative effects; Woodland caribou; Forestry and roads; Rangifer tarandus caribou; current; Anthropogenic disturbances; Step-selection functions Eastern Canada","2013-11-12","3,6",NA,"yes","L","repository",".txt","not given","not given","site coordinates","caribou","2004-2010","2004","2010","source publication text","6","not given","31000","source publication text","other","NA","NA","Plos One","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0077514","no","zenodo"

Multiscale codependence analysis (MCA) quantifies the joint spatial distribution of a pair of variables in order to provide a spatially-explicit assessment of their relationships to one another. For the sake of simplicity, the original definition of MCA only considered a single response variable (e.g. a single species). However, that definition would limit the application of MCA when many response variables are studied jointly, for example when one wants to study the effect of the environment on the spatial organisation of a multi-species community in an explicit manner.
2. In the present paper, we generalize MCA to multiple response variables. We conducted a simulation study to assess the statistical properties (i.e. type I error rate and statistical power) of multivariate MCA (mMCA) and found that it had honest type I error rate and sufficient statistical power for practical purposes, even with modest sample sizes. We also exemplified mMCA by applying it to two ecological data sets.
3. The simulation study confirmed the adequacy of mMCA from a statistical standpoint: it has honest type I error rates and sufficient power to be useful in practice. Using mMCA, we were able to detect variation in fish community structure along the Doubs River (in France), which was associated with large spatial structures in the variation of physical and chemical variables related to water quality. Also, mMCA usefully described the spatial variation of an Oribatid mite community structure associated with a gradient of water content superimposed on various smaller-scale spatial features associated with vegetation cover in the peat blanket surrounding Lac Geai (in Québec, Canada).
4. In addition to demonstrating the soundness of mMCA in theory and practice, we further discuss the strengths and assumptions of mMCA and describe other potential scenarios where it would be helpful to biologists interested in assessing influence of environmental conditions on community structure in a spatially-explicit way. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Script performing simulations and examples calculations<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">The tarball (.tar.gz) archive contains the files to perform the simulation study outlined in the paper and calculate the application examples.

Researchers have recently investigated β-defensin genes in the wild, because their variability suggests that they may play an important role in innate host defense. This study investigated the variation occurring at 6 innate immune genes of the β-defensin family in a declining population of tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) in southern Québec, Canada (N = 160). We found that all 6 genes showed synonymous and nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the exon coding for the mature peptide. These results indicated that this group of genes was diverse in tree swallows. Our results suggested a potential interaction of this group of genes with fluctuating pathogen diversity, however, we found no sign of positive or negative selection. We assessed whether or not the distribution of genetic diversity of β-defensin genes in our study population differed between 2 regions that strongly differ in their level of agricultural intensification. Adults are highly philopatric to their breeding sites and their immunological responses differ between these 2 regions. However, we found little evidence that the level and distribution of genetic variability differed between these heterogeneous environmental conditions. Further studies should aim to assess the link between genetic diversity of β-defensin genes and fitness-related traits in wild populations. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">BD_Arlequin_JoH_Schmitt<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Beta-defensin sequences of tree swallows.

Some of the expected changes result from processes whose effects will be difficult to alter, such as global climate change. We present a novel framework in which we use models to (1) identify the ecological changes from these difficult-to-alter processes, as well as (2) the potential conservation measures that are best able to compensate for these changes. We illustrated this framework with the case of an endangered caribou population in Québec, Canada. We coupled a spatially explicit individual-based movement model with a range of landscape scenarios to assess the impacts of varying degrees of climate change, and the ability of conservation actions to compensate for such impacts on caribou movement behaviors. We found that (1) climate change impacts reduced movement potential, and that (2) the complete restoration of secondary roads inside protected areas was able to fully offset this reduction, suggesting that road restoration would be an effective compensatory conservation action. By evaluating conservation actions via landscape use simulated by an individual-based model, we were able to identify compensatory conservation options for an endangered species facing climate change. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Habitat Quality Maps for caribou movement models<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Archive of 24 tifs of seasonal (winter&amp;summef) habitat quality maps for 12 management/climate change scenarios, as detailed in the manuscript and supplementary material.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">rasterMapsScenarios.rar<br></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div> Anthropocene; movement potential; Rangifer tarandus caribou; road restoration; Caribou Canada; Gaspésie; Québec","2018-11-21","3,6",NA,"yes","M","repository",".tif","distribution model","not given","Map, administrative unit","caribou","1998-2014","1998","2014","source publication text","5","not given","25000","source publication text","distribution","NA","NA","Scientific Reports","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-34822-9","no","zenodo"

Despite the importance of precision and accuracy of genetic variance estimates and their potential sensitivity to various ecological and population specific factors, their reliability is rarely tested explicitly. Here, we used simulations and empirical data collected from an 11-year study on tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), a species showing a high rate of extra-pair paternity and a low recruitment rate, to assess the importance of identity errors, structure and size of the pedigree on quantitative genetic estimates in our dataset. Our simulations revealed an important lack of precision in heritability and genetic-correlation estimates for most traits, a low power to detect significant effects and important identifiability problems. We also observed a large bias in heritability estimates when using the social pedigree instead of the genetic one (deflated heritabilities) or when not accounting for an important cause of resemblance among individuals (for example, permanent environment or brood effect) in model parameterizations for some traits (inflated heritabilities). We discuss the causes underlying the low reliability observed here and why they are also likely to occur in other study systems.

Front. Mar. Sci. 8:677732. doi: 10.3389/fmars.2021.677732</p> <p>In many species of marine benthic invertebrates, a planktonic larval phase plays a critical role in dispersal. Very little is known about the larval biology of most species, however, in part because species identification has historically been hindered by the microscopic size and morphological similarity among related taxa. This study aimed to determine the taxonomic composition and seasonal distribution of meroplankton in the Barents Sea, across the Polar Front. We collected meroplankton during five time points seasonally and used high-throughput DNA barcoding of individual larvae to obtain species-level information on larval seasonality. We found that meroplankton was highly diverse (72 taxa from eight phyla) and present in the Barents Sea year-round with a peak in abundance in August and November, defying the conventional wisdom that peak abundance would coincide with the spring phytoplankton bloom. Ophiuroids, bivalves and polychaetes dominated larval abundance while gastropods and polychaetes accounted for the bulk of the taxon diversity. Community structure varied seasonally and total abundance was generally higher south of the Polar Front while taxon richness was overall greater to the north. Of the species identified, most were known inhabitants of the Barents Sea. However, the nemertean <i>Cephalothrix iwatai</i> and the brittle star <i>Ophiocten gracilis</i> were abundant in the meroplankton despite never having been previously recorded in the northern Barents Sea. The new knowledge on seasonal patterns of individual meroplanktonic species has implications for understanding environment-biotic interactions in a changing Arctic and provides a framework for early detection of potential newcomers to the system.</p> <p>The FASTQ files are housed on NCBI Sequence Read Archive under BioProject name: <span>PRJNA725248 (</span><span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA725248"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA725248</a>).</span></p>

Estimates are often greatly improved when coupled with species distribution models (SDMs), which temper estimates in relation to occurrence.  SDMs can be constructed using from point locality data from a variety of sources including extensive monitoring data typically collected by citizen scientists. However, one potential issue with SDM is that these data oven have sampling bias. To avoid this potential bias, an approach using SDMs based on marsh bird monitoring program data collected by citizen scientists and other participants following protocols specifically designed to maximize detections of species of interest at locations representative of the species range. We then used the SDMs to refine isotopic assignments of breeding areas of autumn-migrating and wintering Sora (Porzana carolina), Virginia Rails (Rallus limicola), and Yellow Rails (Coturnicops noveboracensis) based on feathers collected from individuals caught at various locations in the United States from Minnesota south to Louisiana and South Carolina. Sora were assigned to an area that included much of the western U.S. and prairie Canada, covering parts of the Pacific, Central, and Mississippi Flyways. Yellow Rails were assigned to a broad area along Hudson and James Bay in northern Manitoba and Ontario, as well as smaller parts of Quebec, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, including parts of the Mississippi and Atlantic Flyways. Virginia Rails were from several discrete areas, including parts of Colorado, New Mexico, the central valley of California, and southern Saskatchewan and Manitoba in the Pacific and Central Flyways. Our study demonstrates extensive data from organized citizen science monitoring programs are especially useful for improving isotopic assignments of migratory connectivity in birds, which can ultimately lead to better informed management decisions and conservation actions. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">SDM Variables Part 1<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">part 1 of the input files for SDM creation.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">sdm_variables_1.zip<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">SDM Variables Part 2<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">part 2 of the input files for SDM creation.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">sdm_variables_2.zip<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">SDM Variables Part 3<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">part 3 of the input files for SDM creation.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">sdm_variables_3.zip<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Sora mrange files<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Zip file of the Sora mrange files</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">s_mrange.zip<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Virginia Rail mrange files<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Virginia Rail mrange files</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">vira_mrange.zip<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Yellow Rail mrange files<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Yellow Rail mrange files</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">y_mrange.zip<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Data Files<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">input files for monitoring data, stable isotope data, maping inputs for figures and sdm models saved in .Rdata files.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">data_files.zip<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Intermediate Files<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Intermediate Files from the data cleaning, SDM and assignment process.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">intermediate_files.zip<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Shapefiles<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Shapefiles for each species</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">shapefiles.zip<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">scripts<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">R scripts to create all figures, tables, data cleaning, SDM creation and assignment</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div> Rallus limicola; rails; Coturnicops noveboracensis; porzana carolina; Migratory Connectivity; autumn migration North America","2017-06-06","3,5,8",NA,"yes","H","repository",".csv, other","site IDs, sample coordinates",NA,NA,"Porzana carolina, Rallus limicola, Coturnicops noveboracensis","1995-2015","1995","2015","source publication text, dataset","20","not given","24706834","source publication text","distribution","NA","NA","Journal of Avian Biology","https://doi.org/10.1111/jav.01273","no","dryad"

DNA extractions from fin tissue were conducted using <em>Qiagen</em> blood and tissue kits (Qiagen, Germany) and the manufacturer protocol. To ensure equal quantities of DNA in the pooled samples, DNA quality and quantity were initially assessed by 1% Agarose gel electrophoresis using HindIII digested Lambda DNA run at 100V to assess possible DNA degradation. Multiple quality tests per individual were conducted on a <em>Qubit</em> Fluorometer 2.0 (Invitrogen, USA) selecting for quantity &gt;20 ng/µL and confirmed in a <em>NanoDrop</em> spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) as well as estimates of 260/230 and 260/280 ratios greater than &gt;1.8 quality.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">Individual DNA was then pooled by sex, and population (18 total pools) with 20 individuals in each pool; exceptions were Cobb females (n=17) and both McNair sexes (n=8) due to low population and sample sizes. Twenty individuals per pool were chosen to ensure a balance between available population samples and to have equal representation between sexes (two pools of 20 per population) while maintaining accurate unbiased allele frequency estimates (Anand et al., 2016; Boitard et al., 2012). Albeit from different sexes, the adoption of two pools per population also provided a degree of sampling replication for some population genomic analyses, such as genomic-wide diversity and genetic differentiation. Fifty µL of each individual sample was selected for each pool at a dilution of 10 ng/µL, with DNA concentrations confirmed both prior to and post using a <em>Qubit</em> Fluorometer. DNA was pooled together at a final concentration of 3 ng/µL, confirmed using a <em>Qubit</em> Fluorometer. </p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">Genomic libraries of these pooled DNA samples were prepared by Génome Québec Innovation Centre, Montréal, Québec, Canada via a shotgun approach with PCR with <em>Illumina TrueSeq</em> LT adaptors (Illumina, USA).  All pools passed quality and quantity requirements and were sequenced each on two lanes of <em>NovaSeq 6000 S4</em> flowcell (Illumina) and paired-end reads of 100 base pairs (bp). Coverage was estimated based on the assumption that the brook trout genome is approximately 3Gb, based on the Animal Genome Size Database (<a href=""http://www.genomesize.com/"">http://www.genomesize.com/</a>).</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:11px;text-align:left;"">A reference genome of charr (<em>Salvelinus </em>sp<em>.</em>) available from NCBI (ASM291031v2, Christensen et al., 2018; Genome size = ~2.4GB, scaffold N50 = 1.02Mbp, Contig N50 = 55.6Kbp, masked mapping) was used due to its close phylogenetic and karyotypic relationship with brook trout (Timusk et al., 2011). The reference genome was prepared using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) v 0.7.12 (Li &amp; Durbin, 2009), indexed with SAMtools v 1.5 (Li et al., 2009), and a dictionary was created using Picard tools v 2.17.11 (<a href=""http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/"">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</a>, accessed 20-11-2019) to permit sequence alignment.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:11px;text-align:left;"">SNP discovery was performed using the PPalign module of the PoolParty pipeline v 0.8 (Micheletti &amp; Narum, 2018); the methods and packages in this module are detailed below. Mapping, alignment trimming, and filtering to the charr reference genome were performed with BWA-MEM v 0.7.12, SAMtools v 1.5 using a mapping quality threshold of 10 and SAMblaster v 0.1.24 (Faust &amp; Hall, 2014), while filtering for a quality score threshold of 20 was performed by BBMap v 37.93 (Bushnell, <a href=""sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/"">sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/</a>, accessed 20-11-2019), and summarized with Fastqc v 0.11.7 (Andrews, 2010). SNP filtering was carried out using common parameters for salmonid species, found below (Horn et al., 2020). Duplicate sequences and unpaired reads were filtered using SAMtools, BBMap, and Picard tools with a minimum fastq trimming length of 25bp. An indel window of 15bp was used to mask SNPs around indel regions. SNP calling was facilitated conservatively by BCFtools v 1.5 (Li et al., 2009) with a quality score of 20, a minimum global allele frequency of 0.05, and a minimum global coverage of 10. Raw reads were checked for quality using FastQC <span style=""background:white;"">and MultiQC v1.7 (Ewels et al., 2016). </span>After SNP calling, multiallelic SNPs that could be paralogs were removed following Létourneau et al., 2018; Narum et al., 2017; and Terekhanova et al., 2019. Finally, for all analyses, the PPanalyze module of PoolParty was used to filter out duplicated loci and filter for loci common between all populations with minimum global coverage of 20, maximum global coverage of 100, and minimum allele frequency of 0.05. Of all tested SNPs, the proportion of putatively adaptive loci - i.e. loci with greater deviation from average - was negligible (0.15%), and therefore putatively adaptive loci were not removed. <span style=""background:white;"">Following alignment, <em>mpileup</em> files were run through the PPstats module of PoolParty </span>to estimate depth of coverage, alignment statistics, and genome coverage. Collectively, a total of 362,493 SNPs remained that were common among all populations in the dataset (and biallelic, with scaffold removed); these were used for all subsequent genomic analyses, except the Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) tests described below.</p> <p>Understanding the drivers of successful species invasions is important for conserving native biodiversity and for mitigating the economic impacts of introduced species. However, whole-genome resolution investigations of the underlying contributions of neutral and adaptive genetic variation in successful introductions are rare. Increased propagule pressure should result in greater neutral genetic variation, while environmental differences should elicit selective pressures on introduced populations, leading to adaptive differentiation. We investigated neutral and adaptive variation among nine introduced brook trout (<em>Salvelinus fontinalis</em>) populations using whole-genome pooled sequencing. The populations inhabit isolated alpine lakes in western Canada and descend from a common source, with an average of ~19 (range of 7-41) generations since introduction. We found some evidence of bottlenecks without recovery, no strong evidence of purifying selection, and little support that varying propagule pressure or differences in local environments shaped observed neutral genetic variation differences. Putative adaptive loci analysis revealed non-convergent patterns of adaptive differentiation among lakes with minimal putatively adaptive loci (0.001%-0.15%) that did not correspond with tested environmental variables. Our results suggest that (i) introduction success is not always strongly influenced by genetic load, (ii) observed differentiation among introduced populations can be idiosyncratic, population-specific, or stochastic, and (iii) conservatively, in some introduced species, colonization barriers may be overcome by support through one aspect of propagule pressure or benign environmental conditions.</p> <p>These .sync files are labeled for the entire dataset and for the common loci dataset.

Releases of hatchery-reared fish are more and more recognized to have numerous demographic, ecological and genetic impacts on wild populations. However, consequences on intraspecific trophic relationships have rarely been investigated. In this study, we assessed the impacts of supplementation stocking and resulting introgressive hybridization on the trophic niches occupied by stocked, local and hybrid Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) within populations of piscivorous and planktivorous ecotypes stocked from a wild piscivorous source population. We compared trophic niches using stable isotope analysis (δ13C and δ15N) and trophic position among the three genetic origins. Putative genetic effects were tested with phenotype-genotype association of ""life history"" ecological traits (body size, growth rate, condition index and trophic niche) and genotypes (RADseq SNP markers) using redundant discriminant analysis (RDA). Results showed that sympatry resulting from the stocking of contrasting ecotypes is a risk factor for niche partitioning. Planktivorous populations are more susceptible to niche partitioning, by competitive exclusion of the local fish from a littoral niche to an alternative pelagic/profundal niche. Observed niche partitioning is probably a manifestation of competitive interactions between ecotypes. Our results emphasize that ecotypic variation should be considered for more efficient management and conservation practices and in order to mitigate negative impact of supplementation stocking. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">R script - Stable isotope analyses<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">This file provides all the R codes (scripts) necessary to conduct preliminary and statistical analysis on stable isotopes data for this article.

In waterfowl, remigial moult can be considered as an energy-predation trade-off, meaning that heavier individuals would minimise the flightless period by increasing feather growth rate and energy expenditure. Alternatively, they could reduce body mass at the end of this period, thereby reducing wing-loading to increase flight capability. We studied timing of remigial moult, primary growth rates, flightlessness duration, and the pattern of body mass variation in 5 species of captive seaducks (Melanitta fusca, M. perspicillata, Clangula hyemalis, Histrionicus histrionicus, and Somateria mollissima) ranging in size from 0.5 to 2.0 kg. Their feather growth rates weakly increased with body mass (M0.059) and no correlation was found at the intra-specific level. Consequently, heavier seaduck species and especially heavier individuals had a longer flightless period. Although birds had access to food ad libidum, body mass first increased then decreased, the latter coinciding with maximum feather growth rate. Level of body mass when birds regained flight ability was similar to level observed at the beginning of remigial moult, suggesting they were not using a strategic reduction of body mass to reduce the flightlessness duration. We suggest that the moulting strategy of seaducks may be the result of a compromise between using an intense moult strategy (simultaneous moult) and a low feather growth rate without prejudice to feather quality. Despite the controlled captive status of the studied seaducks, all five species as well as both sexes within each species showed timing of moult reflecting that of wild birds, suggesting there is a genetic component acting to shape moult timing within wild birds. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Seaducks_Data_Viain_et_al<div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div>","2015-07-10","0,3",NA,"yes","X","repository",NA,NA,NA,NA,"5 seaduck species",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"other","NA","NA","Plos One","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0107929","no","zenodo"

Dynamic N-mixture models have been recently developed to estimate demographic parameters of unmarked individuals while accounting for imperfect detection. 2. We propose an application of the Dail and Madsen (2011: Biometrics, 67, 577-587) dynamic N-mixture model in a manipulative experiment using a before-after control-impact design (BACI). Specifically, we tested the hypothesis of cavity limitation of a cavity specialist species, the northern flying squirrel, using nest box supplementation on half of 56 trapping sites. Our main purpose was to evaluate the impact of an increase in cavity availability on flying squirrel population dynamics in deciduous stands in northwestern Québec with the dynamic N-mixture model. We compared abundance estimates from this recent approach with those from classic capture-mark-recapture models and generalized linear models. We compared apparent survival estimates with those from Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) models. 3. Average recruitment rate was 6 individuals per site after 4 years. Nevertheless, we found no effect of cavity supplementation on apparent survival and recruitment rates of flying squirrels. Contrary to our expectations, initial abundance was not affected by conifer basal area (food availability) and was negatively affected by snag basal area (cavity availability). 4. Northern flying squirrel population dynamics are not influenced by cavity availability at our deciduous sites. Consequently, we suggest that this species should not be considered an indicator of old forest attributes in our study area, especially in view of apparent wide population fluctuations across years. 5. Abundance estimates from N-mixture models were similar to those from capture-mark-recapture models, although the latter had greater precision. Generalized linear mixed models produced lower abundance estimates, but revealed the same relationship between abundance and snag basal area. Apparent survival estimates from N-mixture models were higher and less precise than those from CJS models. However, N-mixture models can be particularly useful to evaluate management effects on animal populations, especially for species that are difficult to detect in situations where individuals cannot be uniquely identified. They also allow investigating the effects of covariates at the site level, when low recapture rates would require restricting classic CMR analyses to a subset of sites with the most captures. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Priol et al. 2014.

These data are the processed values (as described in the method section and supporting information of the article) used to model the effects of lemming density and distance to a goose colony on the occurrence of various nesting birds. Mapped data is available in supporting information of the article.</p> <p>Indirect effects resulting from species sharing the same enemy can shape spatio-temporal variations in species occurrence. The strength of such effects remains poorly known in natural communities composed of species from different trophic levels interacting in heterogeneous landscapes. Benefiting from a well-known arctic vertebrate community and marked spatio-temporal variations in the density of key prey species, we examined the effects of direct predator-prey and indirect predator-mediated effects on species occurrence in the landscape. We found both positive effects of one prey (lemmings), as well as negative indirect effects of another prey (colonial nesting snow geese) on the occurrence of species (ground-nesting birds) belonging to different guilds and trophic levels but sharing a common predator (arctic fox). However, species using prey refuges available in the landscape were not or less affected by predator-mediated effects. Similarly, the smallest (a passerine) and the largest and most dangerous species (an owl) for the shared predator were not affected by these effects. Our study provides one of the rare empirical evidence of predator-mediated effects ascending the food web (i.e., negative indirect effect of an herbivore on avian predators) and underlines how habitat structure and species traits can modulate the strength of indirect effects in natural communities.</p> <p>The README file contains column descriptions and general information for the analyses.</p>

We sampled two lakes in summer and autumn of 2017 and repeated the summer and autumn sampling in five lakes in 2018. There are 14 species of fish across all the study lakes (mean 8, range 6-10 species per lake). All lakes have overlapping community compositions, including Salvelinus namaycush, a cold-water top predator, in every lake. Water samples were taken at six depths, dispersed vertically throughout the water column at the deepest centre point of each lake. The sampling points were distributed at six evenly spaced intervals, but because the lakes were different depths, absolute measurements differ between the lakes. One 500 ml water sample was taken per depth (for a total of 6 samples per lake per season) using an electrical pump and Jayflex PVC tubing (Winnipeg Johnston Plastics, MB, Canada) secured to a weight. In total, 84 water samples were taken throughout the entire study (6 samples x 2 lake states x 7 lake replicates). Water was filtered onto 47 mm 0.7 μm pore GF/F filters using an electric vacuum pump and filtering manifold (Pall Corporation, ON, Canada). The filters were divided into two with scissors which had been bleached, rinsed and autoclaved. Half of each filter was immediately stored in screw-cap tubes at -20 ⁰C. The other half was preserved in 370μl RLT buffer (Qiagen) with 1% β-mercaptoethanol and then frozen at -20°C for RNA analysis. One negative control of 500 ml distilled water was stored in the cooler and filtered in the same way as the field samples for each lake. In total, 84 eDNA and 84 eRNA samples were taken across the entire study. Filters were shipped on dry ice to McGill University, Montréal for molecular analysis.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">DNA was extracted from filters using the Qiagen Blood and Tissue kit following the manufacturer's instructions except that 370μl of ATL buffer was added to the filter used in an initial overnight incubation step. After incubation, 325μl of fluid was transferred into an autoclaved microtube for the downstream extraction protocol. RNA was extracted from the filter halves preserved in RLT and β-mercaptoethanol. Extractions of eRNA were performed from the first half of the filter using the Qiagen RNEasy Mini kit with some modifications to accommodate the filter. Filters were vortexed for 20 seconds and centrifuged in the RLT/ β-mercaptoethanol buffer for 3 minutes at 14,000rpm. A total of 325μl of this buffer was mixed with 325μl ethanol and the rest of the procedure followed the kit protocol intended for extracting total RNA from animal cells. The eRNA was resuspended in two elutions of 30μl RNAse free water to give a final volume of 60μl.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">To avoid DNA contamination in the eRNA samples, DNA was digested from 20µl eRNA extracts with the DNA-free™ DNA Removal Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) following the manufacturer's instructions and using 2µl DNase I Buffer, 1µl rDNase I and 2µl DNase Inactivation reagent. RNA samples were checked for residual contaminating DNA using PCR amplification using the MiFish-U primers tagged with Illumina sequencing adapters (Miya et al., 2015). These primers target a hypervariable region of the 12S rRNA locus (163-185bp in length). We used the following PCR chemistry: 7.4µl nuclease free water (Qiagen), 1.25µl 10X buffer (Genscript), 1 mM MgCl2 (ThermoFisher Scientific), 0.2mM GeneDirex dNTPs, 0.05mg bovine serum albumen (ThermoFisher Scientific), 0.25mM each primer, 1U taq (Genscript) and 2µl DNA in a final volume of 12.5µl. We followed a touchdown thermocycling protocol which we have found reduces the amount of non-specific amplification (bacterial taxa) at this locus: 95°C for 3 minutes, 12 cycles of touchdown PCR (98°C for 20 seconds, 66°C for 15 seconds decreasing by 0.2°C each time, 72°C for 15 seconds) followed by 28 cycles with an annealing temperature of 64°C, 72°C extension for 5 minutes. We then visualised the resulting PCR products on 1% agarose gels stained with SYBR Safe. No residual contaminating DNA was found in eRNA samples. A total of 10μl of sample was therefore reverse transcribed into cDNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) in 20µl reactions following the kit instructions.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We then amplified the cDNA and eDNA in triplicate 12.5µl reactions following the MiFish-U PCR protocol laid out above, and checked amplification using 1% agarose gels with SYBR Safe. We then combined the triplicate reactions into one sample and performed a cleanup with AMPure beads using a ratio of 1 part PCR product to 1.2 parts beads. Cleaned amplicons were then dual-indexed using the Nextera v2 DNA indexes, and cleaned again with a ratio of 1 part PCR product to 0.8 parts beads. The second clean-up was performed using a Biomek FX Laboratory liquid handling Automation Workstation (Beckman Coulter, CA). Samples were equimolarised to 3ng/μl and sent for sequencing at Génome Québec, Montréal. Samples were sequenced using 2 x 250bp paired end sequencing with an Illumina MiSeq.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We used custom scripts to remove adapters, merge paired sequences, check quality and generate amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs). Samples were received as demultiplexed fastq files from Génome Québec. Non-biological nucleotides were removed (primers, indices and adapters) using cutadapt. Paired reads were merged using PEAR. Quality scores for sequences were analysed with FASTQC. Amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs) were generated using the UNOISE3 package, which uses a denoising pipeline to remove sequencing error and to cluster sequences into single variants (100% similarity). The full pipeline is available from https://github.com/CristescuLab/YAAP. After ASVs were generated, we assigned taxonomy using BLAST+ and BASTA, a last common ancestor algorithm. We used a custom reference database which contained only fish known to exist in the Lake of the Woods region (Ontario, CA), downloaded from the NCBI database on 12 August 2018.</p> <p>Nucleic acids released by organisms and isolated from environmental substrates are increasingly being used for molecular biomonitoring. While environmental DNA (eDNA) has received attention recently, the potential of environmental RNA as a biomonitoring tool remains less explored. Several recent studies using paired DNA and RNA metabarcoding of bulk samples suggest that RNA might better reflect ""metabolically active"" parts of the community. However, such studies mainly capture organismal eDNA and eRNA. For larger eukaryotes, isolation of extra-organismal RNA will be important, but viability needs to be examined in a field-based setting. In this study we evaluate (a) whether extra-organismal eRNA release from macroeukaryotes can be detected given its supposedly rapid degradation, and (b) if the same field collection methods for eDNA can be applied to eRNA. We collected eDNA and eRNA from water in lakes where fish community composition is well documented, enabling a comparison between the two nucleic acids in two different seasons with monitoring using conventional methods. We found that eRNA is released from macroeukaryotes and can be filtered from water and metabarcoded in a similar manner as eDNA to reliably provide species composition information. eRNA had a small but significantly greater true positive rate than eDNA, indicating that it correctly detects more species known to exist in the lakes. Given relatively small differences between the two molecules in describing fish community composition, we conclude that if eRNA provides significant advantages in terms of lability, it is a strong candidate to add to the suite of molecular monitoring tools.</p> <p>See ReadMe file.</p><p>Funding provided by: Canada Research Chairs<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804<br>Award Number: 230517</p><p>Funding provided by: Canada Research Chairs<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804<br>Award Number: 237170</p><p>Funding provided by: Mitacs<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004489<br>Award Number: IT08003</p><p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: 04331-2017</p><p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: 2016-04016</p><p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: 523760-2018</p><p>Funding provided by: Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science*<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: </p><p>Funding provided by: WSP Montreal Environment department*<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: </p> environmental DNA (eDNA); metabarcoding analysis; eRNA; 12S mitochondrial gene; freshwater biodiversity; freshwater fishes","2022-06-16","3,8,9","location","no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA","NA","NA","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.01.469845; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6478222","no","zenodo"

Preliminary laboratory research has also shown a positive correlation between the concentration of species‐specific eDNA particles and the density/biomass of a species in a given environment. However, the extent to which these results can be extended to natural environments has yet to be formally quantified. We collated data from experiments that examined the correlation between eDNA and two metrics of abundance (biomass and density) and, using mixed‐effects meta‐analysis, quantified the strength of that correlation across laboratory and natural environments. We found that eDNA particle concentration was more strongly correlated with abundance in laboratory environments compared to natural environments, accounting for approximately 82% and 57% of the observed variation in abundance, respectively. We found some evidence of potential publication bias that may have impacted the estimation of the correlation in natural environments; after smaller studies were removed from the dataset, eDNA particle concentration accounted for approximately 50% of the observed variation in abundance in natural environments. No effect of abundance metric was found on the strength of correlation between eDNA particle concentration and abundance. Despite a weaker general correlation in natural environments, eDNA concentration often still explained substantial variation in abundance. eDNA research is still an emergent field of study; with only moderate improvements in technology or technique, it could represent a powerful new tool for quantifying abundance. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Correlation Coefficients and Variance/Covariance Matrix<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Correlation coefficients from published studies on eDNA particle concentration and abundance, including variance/covariance matrix used to account for non-independence of biomass/density correlations obtained from the same experimental subject groups.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Yates_et_al_2019.xlsx<br></div></div><p>Funding provided by: National Science Foundation<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001<br>Award Number: NA</p> Density","2019-06-06","3,4,10","non-relevant information","no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA","NA","NA","https://doi.org/10.1002/edn3.7","no",NA

The role of intraspecific competition and climate in determining the selection of wintering areas by migratory caribou","Where to spend the winter? The role of intraspecific competition and climate in determining the selection of wintering areas by migratory caribou  <p>Depicted as predictable movements, migrations can, however, show important interannual variations, making the conservation of migratory species particularly challenging. Plasticity in migratory behaviour allows individuals to adjust their migratory tactics to maximize their fitness. Destination of migration, and therefore migration patterns, may vary according to climatic and environmental conditions encountered during migration or at the arrival site but also according to competition. In Northern-Québec and Labrador, Canada, fall migration patterns of caribou from the Rivière-George (RGH) and the Rivière-aux-Feuilles (RFH) herds have varied greatly during the last decades. Meanwhile, both herds have shown large fluctuations in abundance. We assessed the influence of environmental factors and changes in population size on wintering area selection. Based on 649 fall migrations of 284 females equipped with ARGOS collars, we used a machine-learning algorithm, the random forests, to assess how climate, resources and population size affected the selection of four different wintering areas. Individuals followed over several years switched to a different wintering area 45% of the time between consecutive years, and this probability increased at high population size. The main determinant of wintering area selection was the population size for both herds, suggesting intra- and inter-herd competition for wintering areas. The long migrations of RGH toward the western wintering areas, also used by RFH, were favoured when the herd was abundant and when the availability of resources was low at the departure. The migrations of RFH toward the south-western area increased as RGH declined, possibly because the past presence of RGH in this area reduced access for caribou from RFH. These results highlight the flexibility in the migratory behaviour of caribou in response to variation in competition. Our study is the first to suggest that wintering area selection can be determined by competition between populations of the same ungulate species.</p> <p>Datasets and R scripts required to run the hierachical cluster analysis and the random forests analyses</p> Rangifer tarandus; winter range","2019-12-17","3,7,4,6",NA,"yes","H","repository",".txt","not given","administrative unit","Map, range coordinates","caribou","1991-2012","1991","2012","source publication text","21","dataset","1000000","source publication text","presence only","NA","NA","Oikos","https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.06668","no","zenodo"

<p><span><span>2.         We used breeding season bird abundance estimates from paired organic-conventional fields in Saskatchewan (31 pairs), Ontario (36), and Québec (15), Canada to test two alternative predictions: That the positive effect of organic farming on bird abundance was; a) smaller when controlling for overall effects of local- and landscape-scale agricultural intensity (accounting for main effects on abundance); or b) increases with local- or landscape-scale agricultural intensity (an interaction effect of intensity x organic farming). We also evaluated whether positive effects of organic farming were stronger in regions with greater agricultural intensity.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>3.         The estimated effect of organic farming on the cross-species abundance of birds was only statistically supported in Ontario when not accounting for agricultural intensity. However, the estimated effect of organic farming was the same whether or not we controlled for agricultural intensity in Saskatchewan (supported positive effect) and Québec (unsupported effect). Little support existed for more positive effects of organic farming on abundance in areas with greater local- or landscape-scale agricultural intensity. In Ontario, there was a non-significant trend for more positive effects of organic farming in more intensively-farmed landscapes.</span></span></p>

<p><span>4.         Our results showed, for the first time in North America, an effect of regional-scale agricultural intensity on the potential benefit of organic farms. The influence of organic farming on abundance was most positive in the region with the most intensive agriculture (Saskatchewan) and least positive in the region with the least intensive agriculture (Québec). Additionally, we showed that benefits of organic farming can be overestimated if the effects of local- and landscape-scale agricultural intensity are not considered. However, positive effects of organic farming on cross-species abundance and the abundance of individual species were still detectable when we controlled for agricultural intensity at local- and landscape-scales.  </span></p>

<p><span><span>5.         <i>Synthesis and applications</i>. When evaluating impacts of organic farming on biodiversity, it is important to consider the intensity of surrounding agricultural practices at local to regional scales. Our cross-regional comparison showed that organic farming had the most positive effect on abundance of birds in the region with the most intensive agriculture (Saskatchewan) and least positive effect in the region with the least intensive agriculture (Québec).  This demonstrates that birds can benefit from organic farming and this effect can be most pronounced in regions with more intensive agriculture, implying that birds may benefit most from expansion of the area of organic farming in regions where farming is most intensive.</span></span></p> <p>These data contain all of the information used in the associated paper.  Note that we omitted some bird point count sites from analyses because they did not have matching paired sites on the opposite farm type.</p>

Emergence, number of true leaves and survival (after drought) were recorded every 2 d until all plants were harvested. Harvested leaves and roots at four, eight, 12 and 18 weeks were measured using an EPSON Expression 11000XL photo scanner and analysed using imaging software (WinRhizo software v2007, Regent Instruments Inc.

<p>Survival after drought of <i>B. menziesii </i>seedlings ranged from 14 to 31 days with pellet + surfactant surviving approximately 2.6 days (11.8%) longer than the control seeds. For the second species, <i>L. inermis</i>,<i> </i>seedling emergence under field conditions was approximately 24% greater in seedlings derived from extruded pellets, however there was no difference in overall survival due to post-emergence predation.</p>

<p>This study provides a proof of concept that seedling emergence in water repellent soils can be enhanced with extruded pellets containing surfactants. Our demonstration under <i>in situ</i> and <i>ex situ</i> conditions confirms the prospective use of seed enhancement technologies with future development and field-testing warranted.</p> <p>Contact the lead author for further information.</p>

Each site varied in plot size, where the total area of mapped grids ranged from 200-320 m in width and 200-1000 m in plot length. All trees within the study grid had their coordinates mapped using Leica Flexline© TS06 and TCR805 Total Stations. Each tree with a diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥10.0 cm was mapped, identified by species, given a health status (living, dead, declining, fallen) and its DBH (1.3 m) measured. In the late spring of 2015, four recruitment plots (1 m<sup>2</sup>) were established within each of the 20 x 20 m grids at a 5 x 5 m spacing (3,424 total recruitment plots across all three sites). Recruitment was measured as stem tallies by species over two years (2015 and 2016) for two recruitment stages: (i) first-year seedlings (referred to as stage 1 seedlings); identified by the presences of cotyledons, absence of terminal bud scars, suppleness of the stem, and number of leaves, (ii) older seedlings (referred to as stage 2 seedlings); which were not first year and were &lt;30.0 cm in height. We visually estimated the percent coverage (to the nearest 5%, total summing to 100%) of the recruitment plots by the following substrates: grass, leaf, needles, moss, decayed logs, solid logs, and bole cover from overstorey/sapling trees. In addition to the substrates, we also assessed the cover of deciduous plant cover (non-canopy tree species) within the recruitment plot.</p>

<p> </p> <p> Temperate tree species are expected to expand their distribution into the boreal forest in response to climate change. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that many species will experience significant setbacks in capacity to migrate due to a series of unfavourable conditions impacting their recruitment success, and thus their ability to colonize new locations. We quantify the relative influence of a series of factors important for tree seedling recruitment at range margins: propagule dispersal, substrate favourability, and the influence of the local hetero-specific species canopy composition. We hypothesized that boreal trees are responsible for priority effects that influence the establishment of temperate tree species seedlings. To do so, we analyzed two recruitment stages (first-year seedlings and older seedlings) for seven tree species; Abies balsamea (ABBA), Acer rubrum (ACRU), Acer saccharum (ACSA), Betula papyrifera (BEPA), Betula alleghaniensis (BEAL), Populus tremuloides (POTR), and Fagus grandifolia (FAGR) commonly found within the temperate-boreal ecotone forests of northeastern North America. Overall, we found that boreal canopy trees influence the distribution of substrates, more specifically the occurrence of needle cover and decayed wood in recruitment plots. Interestingly, decayed wood was a poor substrate in almost all cases. This association between canopy and substrate led to highly unfavourable substrates that affected the seedling densities of all temperate tree species. In addition, we found that seedling dispersion was highly localized, where the mean dispersal distance of all trees occurred in close proximity of parent trees. Unfavourable substrates and limited MDD (mean dispersal distance) of trees due to resident boreal trees generate (strong) priority effects within the temperate-boreal ecotone. Together these conditions promise to cause significant lags in temperate tree species migration into the boreal forest in the future.</p> <p><b>Permanent Plots - Tree Species Codes</b></p>

Emerald ash borer that were heat treated and that emerged as adult insects were maintained under laboratory conditions to record lifespan, fertility and fecundity.</p> Addressing the risk from pests present in wood and wood products destined for international trade is an essential step towards minimizing the movement, introduction and establishment of invasive species. One method of managing the pest risk associated with wood commodities is the use of a systems approach which incorporates multiple independent measures applied along a  production pathway. However, quantifying the reduction of risk can be difficult because the approach requires raw material infested with the pest of interest at a sufficient density to be able to quantify changes in pest abundance. We tested a systems approach for the production of sawn wood using emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) -infested ash (Fraxinus) by quantifying the change in pest density during the milling process and the precise effect of heat treatment on insects in situ. Greater than 90% of emerald ash borer were removed at the first step of the milling process (debarking) and &gt;99% were removed before the production of green sawn wood. No insects survived kilning or heat treatment. All life stages of emerald ash borer were killed at 56 °C and above. Heat, however, had no sub-lethal effect on emerald ash borer performance. These results show that the application of a systems approach to mitigate emerald ash borer in heat-treated, sawn wood is effective. Moreover, the model-system approach developed in this study can be a template for investigating the effect of systems approaches for other phloem-feeding insects. <p>All data are provided in .Rdata files and can be opened in the R Statistical computing language.

The degree to which the phylogenetic relatedness in plant communities is in accord with limiting similarity has been little tested at the scale where the consequences of adaptive differentiation during speciation should be most evident: the scale of neighboring, congeneric plants within a community. To quantify species co-occurrence patterns in relation to environment, we sampled sedge species, their rooting level relative to the water table, and the water pH in 2,124 0.25 m² quadrats distributed across 29 subarctic fens in the central Labrador Peninsula. We estimated phylogenetic relationships using four DNA regions (ETS, ITS, matK, trnL-trnF) for all species of Carex (42), Eriophorum (6), and Trichophorum (2) in the region, of which 21, four, and two, respectively, occurred in the sampled fens. We demonstrate that closely related species of Carex are less likely to co-occur than expected by chance using 1) a probabilistic method to test the significance of pairwise co-occurrence patterns of species, and 2) linear mixed modeling to relate these patterns to phylogenetic relationships and ecological tolerances along gradients of substrate pH and rooting level in relation to the water table. The results also indicate that suites of species with significant mutual pairwise co-occurrence belong to distant lineages within the Cariceae-Dulichieae-Scirpeae clade of Cyperaceae and have stabilizing niche differences. We suggest that niche differentiation during the evolution and diversification of a clade of wetland Carex species over the past few million years, especially during the dynamic glacial cycles of the Pleistocene, has resulted in diverse sedge communities that share space and resources in harsh northern peatland habitats. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Supplemental Table 1<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">csv file with field sampling data for species co-occurences, rooting level and pH values in each of the 0.25 m2 quadrats sampled in the Schefferville fens, with accompanying READ_ME.rtf file giving details of sampling method and defining abbreviations</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Supplemental_Table_1_Quadrat_by_species_env_matrix.csv<br></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Supplemental_Table_2<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">csv file giving co-occurrence results for all pairwise combinations of Cyperaceae species in Schefferville fens, with accompanying READ_ME.rtf file giving details of column headings and abbreviations used.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">DNA alignment<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Alignment of sequence data for ETS, ITS, matK, trnL-trnF regions for species of Cyperaceae in Schefferville fens</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Supplemental_Figure_1<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Summary tree of BEAST results for alternative analysis using two secondary calibrations for dating the phylogenetic tree of Cyperaceae species from Schefferville fens</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Supplemental_Figure_2<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Summary tree from BEAST analysis using a secondary calibration for the root and Carex colwellensis to data the crown node of Carex</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div> nuclear ribosomal spacers; Tertiary and Quaternary; Carex vaginata; limiting similarity; Carex chordorrhiza; community phylogenetics; Eriophorum viridicarinatum; Carex aquatilis; Carex rostrata; Carex gynocrates; Carex tsiangii; Carex pachygyna; Carex limosa; pairwise co-occurrence; ecophylogenetics; present; Carex livida; Carex heleonastes; Carex tenuiflora; Eriophorum chamissonis; Carex disperma; Carex trisperma; Carex pauciflora; niche differentiation;; Carex siderosticta; Coexistence theory; Eriophorum vaginatum; Carex echinata; Carex exilis; Carex magellanica; plastid DNA; Carex leptalea; Eriophorum angustifolium; Carex gibba; divergence times; Trichophorum cespitosum; Coexistence theory; Carex saxatilis; Carex rariflora; subarctic peatlands; quadrat sampling; Carex oligosperma; Carex canescens; Cyperaceae; Trichophorum alpinum; DNA alignment; Carex utriculata Central Quebec-Labrador peninsula","2017-04-29","3,5,8",NA,"yes","M","repository",".csv","site IDs","not given","Map","Carex (42), Eriophorum (6), and Trichophorum (2) species",NA,"not given","not given","NA",NA,"not given","700","source publication text, dataset","presence-absence","NA","NA","Systematic Botany","https://doi.org/10.1600/036364416x692514","no","dryad"

<p>1) On the plots, all trees (diameter above 9cm) were identified to the species and their diameter was measured. The trees were also attributed to a distance-to-the-shore class, and were designated as cut or uncut by the beavers.</p>
<p>2) On the plots, we selected 10 subplots (5m of diameter), and realized the same protocol as the one for the trees, but for the shrubs and saplings (diameter under 9cm).</p> <p>The beaver (<em>Castor canadensis</em> Khul) is a key species that is known to shape the composition of riparian forests. Ash trees (<em>Fraxinus</em> spp.) can be abundant in these forests. However, invasion by the emerald ash borer (<em>Agrilus planipennis </em>Fairmaire) in North America threatens their survival. The disappearance of ash will have a large impact on the riparian forest composition in itself. It is not known what the consequences would be for the remaining forest if ash plays an important role in the beaver diet. Inventory plots across a ash gradient were measured in Plaisance National Park, Quebec, Canada, to collect data and to establish if (1) trees and saplings of this genus were selected or avoided by beavers, (2) if other genera had a lower or a greater probability of being consumed compared to ash, and (3) if ash density could affect the probability of consumption of other genera. Of all genera present in the park, ash trees were selected in the highest number of plots. Only two genera, <em>Carpinus</em> and <em>Populus</em>, had a higher probability of being consumed than ash. These genera are not abundant in the park, and neither in riparian forests of the temperate biome, and thus are not good candidates to replace ash as a staple for beavers. The most abundant genus in riparian temperate forests, along with ash, is <em>Acer</em>. In this study, <em>Acer</em> trees were not selected, and as for <em>Acer</em> saplings, were less likely to be consumed than ash. Mixed results were obtained about genera that could become more likely to be consumed as ash density decreases. It would seem that the disappearance of ash would not cause a switch to a single or a few genera in the future, which may be due to the high diversity of genera present in temperate riparian forests. However, ash may not disappear completely due to its capacity to sprout following the death of the aboveground portion of ash trees. This scenario is discussed in light of the susceptibility of intermediate-sized ash stems to be colonized by the emerald ash borer and of the greater likelihood of beavers to feed on these same-sized stems.</p> <p>All the analyses described in our manuscript have been realized with R software 4.1.0</p><p>Funding provided by: Mitacs<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004489<br>Award Number: IT10755</p><p>Funding provided by: SÉPAQ*<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: </p> Castor canadensis; Fraxinus spp; emerald ash borer; Feeding behavior; Riparian forests; Temperate biome","2022-11-18","3,2",NA,"yes","L","repository",".xlsx","site IDs","not given","administrative unit","Castor canadensis, Agrilus planipennis, c.30 plant species","2019","2019","2019","source publication text","<1","not given","28","source publication text","presence-only","NA","NA","Forests","NA","no","zenodo"

While species utilization of the landscape is usually viewed as constant within a year, the spatial distribution of individuals is likely to vary in time in relation to particular seasonal needs. Understanding temporal variation in landscape use and genetic connectivity has direct conservation implications. Here, we modelled the daily use of the landscape by caribou in Quebec and Labrador, Canada and tested its ability to explain the genetic relatedness among individuals. We assessed habitat selection using locations of collared individuals in migratory herds and static occurrences from sedentary groups. Connectivity models based on habitat use outperformed a baseline isolation-by-distance model in explaining genetic relatedness, suggesting that variations in landscape features such as snow, vegetation productivity and land use modulate connectivity among populations. Connectivity surfaces derived from habitat use were the best predictors of genetic relatedness. The relationship between connectivity surface and genetic relatedness varied in time and peaked during the rutting period. Landscape permeability in the period of mate searching is especially important to allow gene flow among populations. Our study highlights the importance of considering temporal variations in habitat selection for optimizing connectivity across heterogeneous landscape and counter habitat fragmentation. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Yannic_data_DRYAD_RSPB-2014-0502<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Introductory information: Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) capture and genotype data.

Fewer studies have examined diversifying populations with occasional adaptive variation and minor reproductive isolation, so factors impeding or facilitating the progress of early stage differentiation are less understood. We detected non-random genetic structuring in lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) inhabiting a large, pristine, postglacial lake (Mistassini Lake, Canada), with up to five discernible genetic clusters having distinctions in body shape, size, colouration and head shape. However, genetic differentiation was low (FST = 0.017) and genetic clustering was largely incongruent between several population- and individual-based clustering approaches. Genotype- and phenotype-environment associations with spatial habitat, depth and fish community structure (competitors and prey) were either inconsistent or weak. Striking morphological variation was often more continuous within than among defined genetic clusters. Low genetic differentiation was a consequence of relatively high contemporary gene flow despite large effective population sizes, not migration-drift disequilibrium. Our results suggest a highly plastic propensity for occupying multiple habitat niches in lake trout and a low cost of morphological plasticity, which may constrain the speed and extent of adaptive divergence. We discuss how factors relating to niche conservatism in this species may also influence how plasticity affects adaptive divergence, even where ample ecological opportunity apparently exists. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">MARIN_Mistassini_lake trout<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">All genetic, morphological and ecological data used for analyses in Striking Phenotypic Variation Yet Low Genetic Differentiation in Sympatric Lake Trout (<i>Salvelinus namaycush<i>).

Phylogenetic tools have increasingly been used in community ecology to describe evolutionary relationships among co-occurring species. In studies of succession, such tools may allow us to identify evolutionary lineages most suited for particular stages of succession and habitat rehabilitation. However, to date these two applications have been largely separate. Here, we suggest that information on phylogenetic community structure might help inform community restoration strategies following major disturbance. 2. Our study examined phylogenetic patterns of succession based on a chronosequence of three abandoned subarctic mine spoil heaps (waste piles) dating from the early 1970s, mid-1970s and early 1980s. The vegetation at each mine site was compared to the surrounding vegetation and community structure on mines was explored assuming species pools at nested spatial scales. 3. We found that the adjacent vegetation was more phylogenetically clustered than the vegetation on the mines, with mines demonstrating weaker phylogenetic community structure. Using simulation models, we showed that phylogenetic dissimilarity between mine sites did not depart from null expectations. However, we found evidence for species sorting along abiotic gradients (slope and aspect) on the mine sites that had been abandoned for the longest. 4. Synthesis and applications. Understanding the trajectory of succession is critical for restoration efforts. Our results suggest that early colonizers represent a phylogenetically random subset of species from the local species pool. Over time there appears to be selection for particular lineages that come to be filtered across space and environment. The species most appropriate for mine site restoration might, therefore, depend on the successional stage of the community and the local species composition. For example, in later succession, it could be more beneficial to facilitate establishment of more distant relatives. Our findings can improve management practices by providing relatedness information for known successful colonizers and by informing seeding decisions with knowledge of the surrounding and regional species pools. The application of phylogenetics to restoration ecology and succession is relatively new, but it has the potential to provide novel insight into the dynamics of changing community structures during succession. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Schefferville Mines: Gagnon mine and surrounding vegetation flora<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Site by species matrix of species found on and around the Gagnon mine in Schefferville, Quebec, Canada.

Following the adoption of the Wild Salmon Policy in Canada, CUs were defined for Pacific salmon based on characteristics related to ecotype, life history, and genetic variation using microsatellite markers as indirect measures of local adaptation. Genomic datasets have the potential to improve the definition of CUs by reducing variance around estimates of population genetic parameters, thereby increasing the power to detect more subtle patterns of population genetic structure and by providing an opportunity to incorporate adaptive information more directly with the identification of variants putatively under selection. We used one of the largest genomic datasets recently published for a non-model species, comprising 5,662 individual Coho salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) from 149 sampling locations and a total of 24,542 high-quality SNPs obtained using genotyping-by-sequencing and mapped to the Coho salmon reference genome to 1) evaluate the current delineation of CUs for Coho in Canada and 2) compare patterns of population structure observed using neutral and outlier loci from genotype-environment association analyses to determine whether separate CUs that capture adaptive diversity are needed. Our results reflected CU boundaries on the whole, with the majority of sampling locations managed in the same CU clustering together within genetic groups. However, additional groups not currently represented by CUs were also uncovered. We observed considerable overlap in the genetic clusters identified using neutral or candidate loci, indicating a general congruence in patterns of genetic variation driven by local adaptation and gene flow in this species. Consequently, we suggest that the current CU boundaries for Coho salmon are largely well-suited for meeting the Canadian Wild Salmon Policy's objective of defining biologically distinct groups, but we highlight specific areas where CU boundaries may be refined.</span></p> <p>Funding provided by: Genome Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008762<br>Award Number: </p><p>Funding provided by: Genome British Columbia<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000233<br>Award Number: </p><p>Funding provided by: Genome Quebec*<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: </p> conservation genomics; conservation planning; genotype-environment association; genotyping-by-sequencing; salmon","2022-10-21","3,8,6","location","no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","no","zenodo"

However, it remains unclear how climate-mediated variation in species' environmental niche space may lead to large-scale fragmentation of species distributions, altered meta-population dynamics and gene flow, and disrupted ecosystem integrity. Such change may be especially relevant when species distributions are restricted either spatially or to a narrow environmental niche, or when environments are rapidly changing. Here, we use range-wide environmental niche models to posit that climate-mediated range fragmentation aggravates the direct effects of climate change on species in the boreal forest of North America. We show that climate change will directly alter environmental niche suitability for boreal-obligate species of trees, birds and mammals (n=12), with most species ranges becoming smaller and shifting northward through time. Importantly, species distributions will become increasingly fragmented, as characterized by smaller mean size and greater isolation of environmentally-suitable landscape patches. This loss is especially pronounced along the Ontario-Québec border, where the boreal forest is narrowest and roughly 78% of suitable niche space could disappear by 2080. Despite the diversity of taxa surveyed, patterns of range fragmentation are remarkably consistent, with our models predicting that spruce grouse (Dendragapus canadensis), boreal chickadee (Poecile hudsonicus), moose (Alces americanus) and caribou (Rangifer tarandus) could have entirely disjunct east-west population segments in North America. These findings reveal potentially dire consequences of climate change on population continuity and species diversity in the boreal forest, highlighting the need to better understand: 1) extent and primary drivers of anticipated climate-mediated range loss and fragmentation; 2) diversity of species to be affected by such change; 3) potential for rapid adaptation in the most strongly-affected areas; and 4) potential for invasion by replacement species. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">GeoTIFF files of suitable climate for boreal species<div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">fragstat_files.rar<br></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div> Holocene Canada","2018-04-25","3,4,6",NA,"yes","H","repository","GeoTIFF","not given","not given","no","Dendragapus canadensis, Poecile hudsonicus, Alces americanus, Rangifer tarandus, other 8 mammals, 4 tree species, 3 bird species","1950-2000","1950","2000","source publication text","50","not given","24706834","source link abstract","distribution","NA","NA","Plos One","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0176706","no","dryad"

Ballast water has been a principal pathway of nonindigenous species introduction to global ports for much of the 20th century. In an effort to reduce the scale of this pathway, and recognizing forthcoming global regulations that will supplant ballast water exchange (BWE) with ballast water treatment (BWT), we explore whether a combined hybrid treatment of BWE and chlorination (Cl) exceeds individual effects of either BWE or chlorination alone in reducing densities of bacteria, microplankton and macroplankton. 2. Five full-scale trials were conducted on an operational bulk carrier travelling between Canada and Brazil. 3. The hybrid treatment generally had the lowest final densities among all treatments for putative enterococci, Escherichia coli, and coliform bacteria, as well as microplankton and macroplankton, with the former two being synergistically lower than individual treatments alone. Microplankton abundance in the hybrid treatment was significantly but antagonistically reduced relative to individual treatments alone. Macroplankton final density was lowest in the hybrid treatment, though the interaction between treatments was not significant. 4. Synthesis and applications. In most cases the combined hybrid treatment of ballast water exchange (BWE) and chlorination reduced population densities of indicator organisms in ballast water below those proposed by the International Maritime Organization's D-2 performance standards. BWE alone was often ineffective at reducing bacterial and macroplankton densities. Even when performance standards are implemented globally, continued use of BWE could further reduce risk of invasions to freshwater ecosystems that receive ballast water from foreign sources by accentuating the decline in propagule pressure and enhancing demographic constraints for putative invaders. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Hybrid system increases efficiency of ballast water treatment<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Environmental and biological initial and final values collected on the study ""Hybrid system increases efficiency of ballast water treatment""</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Data Accessibility-Hybrid system increases efficiency of ballast water treatment.xlsx<br></div></div> IMO-D2; coliform; Vibrio cholerae; Synergistic; ballast water treatment; additive; chlorine; alien species; nonindigenous; enterococci Bécancour; Canada; Saint Lawrence River; Port Alfred; Atlantic Ocean; Quebec; Brazil; Trois Rivières; Saguenay River","2015-02-02","3,4,6,10","non biological","no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA","NA","NA","https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12397","no","dryad"

Within these multitrophic systems, parasitoids can be stabilizing agents by dispersing toward patches containing higher host density (the so-called <i>birdfeeder effect</i>). However, we know little about the dispersal abilities of parasitoids in continuous forested landscapes, limiting our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of host–parasitoid systems, and constraining our ability to predict forest resilience in the context of global changes. In this study, we investigate the spatial genetic structure and spatial variation in genetic diversity of two important species of spruce budworm larval parasitoids during outbreaks: <i>Apanteles fumiferanae</i> Viereck (Braconidae) and <i>Glypta fumiferanae </i>(Viereck) (Ichneumonidae).

Using DAPC, PCA, AMOVA, and IBD analyses, we found evidence for panmixia and high genetic connectivity for both species, matching the previously described genetic structure of the spruce budworm within the same context, suggesting similar effective dispersal during outbreaks and high parasitoid population densities between outbreaks. We also found a significant negative relationship between genetic diversity and latitude for <i>A. fumiferanae</i> but not for <i>G. fumiferanae</i>, suggesting that northern range limits may vary by species within the spruce budworm parasitoid community.

Knowing the relative contribution of vegetative propagation and sexual reproduction to the dispersal and establishment of exotic plants is crucial for devising efficient control strategies. This is particularly true for the common reed (Phragmites australis), one of the most invasive species in North America. 2. For the first time we combined in situ field observations and genetic evidence, based on two genotyping techniques, i.e., microsatellite markers (SSR) and genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), to determine the propagation strategies of this invader at its northern distribution limit in North America, and especially in roadside ditches. 3. Field observations revealed that, in a region where the common reed is already abundant, both seeds and plant fragments contributed to the establishment of new populations. Newly established individuals originated mostly (84%) from seeds rather than fragments, but a larger proportion of individuals originating from fragments survived the second year compared to seedlings. 4. High genetic diversity among marsh and roadside common reed stands indicated the prime role of sexual reproduction for dispersal. The vast majority of genotypes were found in only one stand; such high genetic variability can only be explained by sexual reproduction. Half the surveyed stands comprised a single clone, suggesting that local expansion mainly occurred vegetatively. As the small proportion of SSR genotypes initially thought to be common between distant stands proved to be distinct (as revealed by GBS data), it is likely that all the stands examined were initially founded by genetically distinct individuals. 5. Synthesis. Our study suggests that long-distance dispersal by seeds is important for the common reed, in marshes and roadsides, while both seeds and plant fragments contribute to short-distance dispersal along roads, at least in regions where the species is already abundant. The success of this invader in North America seems to be attributable to a reproduction strategy combining the advantages of sexuality with those of vegetative propagation. Moreover, this study shows that the GBS approach strongly reduces uncertainties associated with the use of a limited number of markers. This approach is especially valuable for ecologists dealing with an ever increasing number of invaders, of which few have identified microsatellite markers. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Albert_etal_JEcol<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Genetic data (SSR, SNP) from Phragmites australis populations sampled along highways and in marshes of southern Québec, Canada</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div> genotyping-by-sequencing; Phragmites australis; road ecology; sexual reproduction; common reed; Invasion ecology; vegetative propagation; freshwater wetlands Canada; Québec","2016-08-28","3,6",NA,"yes","L","repository",".xlsx","site IDs","not given","Map, geological feature me","Phragmites australis","2009","2009","2009","source publication text","<1","not given","416","source publication text","EBV genetic analysis","NA","NA","Journal of Ecology","https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12473","no","dryad"

<p>Vascular plant species cover data at each site. One 400 m2 circular plot was randomly positioned in each of the 33 selected stands. In each circular plot, 20 quadrats (1 m2) were arranged in a cross shape pointing at the four cardinal directions with five quadrats on each branch. A survey of the vascular understory vegetation was carried out inside each quadrat by identifying all herbaceous and woody species and defining their percent cover based on vertical projections. Percentages were visually assessed by two independent observers and rare species (&lt;1% cover) were assigned a cover of 0.5%. For each site, plant covers were summed up by species using the 20 quadrats (covers ranged from 0-2000). </p>

Partitioning of genetic variation (AFLP), isolation by distance and clustering analyses indicate that these morphospecies are locally differentiated genetically.

The PinPoint-75 model receives and transmits location data remotely through the Argos system, which allows data to be dowloaded without the need to recapture the bird. All data was accessed in ArgosWeb (https://argos-system.clsamerica.com/argos-cwi2/login.html) and processed through a proprietary sofware called Lotek Argos-GPS Data Processor V4.2.

To run the analyses outlined in the manuscript (probability of occurence in harvest zones and predictors of occurence in harvest zones) we truncated the data to only include locations from July 1 through October 21 of each year. We restricted our analysis to southward migration, ending on October 21 for three reasons. First, harvest policies in the jurisdictions of the harvest zones we examined indicate that most Lesser Yellowlegs harvest occurs during southward migration when flocks of shorebirds stop in the Lesser Antilles and northeastern South America due to seasonal weather events such as hurricanes and tropical depressions. Second, the predefined GPS tag schedules limited the number of transmissions received after October 21 in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Lastly, of the 69 (82%) individuals tracked throughout the non-breeding period, none of the individuals occurred in harvest zones after October 21 that had not already been previously observed there.</p>

<p>To run a continuous-time state-space random walk model we used package <i>foieGras</i> 0.4.0 in program R. To run a binomial generalized linear model we used package <i>MASS</i> 7.3-53 in program R. Code is provided in association with the location data .csv files.</p> <p>Shorebirds have experienced a precipitous reduction in abundance over the past four decades. While some threats to shorebirds are widespread (e.g. habitat alteration), others are regional and may affect specific populations. Lesser Yellowlegs (<i>Tringa flavipes</i>) are long-distance migrants that breed across the North American boreal biome and have declined in abundance by 60-80% since the 1970s. The documented harvest of Lesser Yellowlegs in the Caribbean and northeastern South America during southward migration is a possible limiting factor for the species, but it is unknown to what extent birds from different breeding origins may be affected. To address the question of differential occurrence in harvest zones during southward migration, we used PinPoint GPS Argos transmitters to track the southward migrations of 85 adult Lesser Yellowlegs from across the species' breeding range and 80° of longitude from Anchorage, Alaska, USA to the Mingan Archipelago, Quebec, Canada. We classified migratory locations as inside or outside three zones with high levels of harvest (Caribbean, coastal Guianas, and coastal Brazil) and then fit generalized additive mixed models to estimate the probability of occurrence of Lesser Yellowlegs in harvest zones according to their breeding origin. Individuals from the Eastern Canada population had a higher probability of occurrence within one or more harvest zones and remained in those zones longer than individuals breeding in Alaska and western Canada. Linear regressions also suggested that longitude of the breeding origin is an important predictor of occurrence in harvest zones during southward migration. Lastly, our findings, combined with other sources of evidence, suggest that current estimated harvest rates may exceed sustainable limits for Lesser Yellowlegs, which warrants further investigation.</p> <p>The dataset does not include any missing values.

Forest productivity may be determined not only by biodiversity but also by environmental factors and stand structure attributes. However, the relative importance of these factors in determining productivity is still controversial for subtropical forests.
2. Based on a large dataset from 600 permanent forest inventory plots across subtropical China, we examined the relationship between biodiversity and forest productivity and tested whether stand structural attributes (stand density in terms of trees per ha, age and tree size) and environmental factors (climate and site conditions) had larger effects on productivity. Furthermore, we quantified the relative importance of environmental factors, stand structure and diversity in determining forest productivity.
3. Diversity, together with stand structure and site conditions, regulated the variability in forest productivity. The relationship between diversity and forest productivity did not vary along environmental gradients. Stand density and age were more important modulators of forest productivity than diversity.
4. Synthesis. Diversity had significant and positive effects on productivity in species-rich subtropical forests, but the effects of stand density and age were also important. Our work highlights that while biodiversity conservation is often important, the regulation of stand structure can be even more important to maintain high productivity in subtropical forests. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Data_Dryad<div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div> subtropical forests; biodiversity and ecosystem functioning; environmental conditions Subtropical China","2019-04-24","3,7,2,10","location","no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA","NA","NA","https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.13194","no","zenodo"

<p>Non-climatic constraints on species northern range boundaries are often overlooked in attempts to predict climate-induced range shifts. Here, we examined the effects of habitat availability and fire disturbance on the distribution of eastern white cedar (<i>Thuja occidentalis</i> L.) at the northern boundary of its range.</p>

Location

<p>North-western Quebec, Canada (46-51° N and 74-79° W)</p>

Methods

<p>We used forest inventory data (<i>n</i>=4,987) to characterize white-cedar habitat based on edaphic and topographic conditions at sampled sites along a 600-km latitudinal gradient. Non-metric multidimensional scaling was used to assess habitat similarity of sites in the south, where white-cedar stands are abundant, and sites in the north, where white-cedar stands are rare. We constructed ensemble white cedar distribution models based on habitat variables in the south and compared ensemble forecast projections of white cedar in the north with observed occurrences to determine if habitat availability was limiting. We independently estimated the age of white-cedar stands and adjacent stands without white cedar along the gradient. ANOVA was performed to test the age difference between white-cedar and adjacent stands to determine if the location of white-cedar stands was influenced by disturbance, primarily stand-replacing fire.</p>

Results

<p>Habitat availability was not limiting the distribution of eastern white cedar at its northern range boundary. White cedar did not occupy most sites with suitable habitat in the north, suggesting that other factors prevent white cedar from establishing more stands northward. White-cedar stands were older than adjacent stands without white cedar all along the gradient, but the difference was more pronounced in the north. This suggests that white-cedar stands in the north are restricted to undisturbed areas.</p>

Main conclusions

<p>Fire disturbance, more than habitat availability, limits the distribution of white cedar at its northern range boundary. Projections of white cedar distribution under climate change that ignore fire could overestimate the ability of warming temperatures to extend its northern range limit.</p> <p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: STPGP 336871</p><p>Funding provided by: Fonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et technologies<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003151<br>Award Number: </p>","2021-09-21","3,7,2,5",NA,"yes","H","repository",".csv","sample coordinates","not given","Map, range coordinates","Thuja occidentalis","1986-2000","1986","2000","source publication text","24","not given","240000","not given","presence only","NA","NA","Journal of Biogeography","https://doi.org/https://mffp.gouv.qc.ca/publications/forets/connaissances/Norme-PET.pdf; https://doi.org/https://mffp.gouv.qc.ca/publications/forets/connaissances/Norme-PEP.pdf; https://doi.org/10.7809/b-e.00219; https://doi.org/http://charcoal.cnre.vt.edu/climate/","no","dryad"

Snowpatches are disjunct arctic ecosystems scattered across the Subarctic, particularly on wind-protected lee slopes, where a thick snow cover accumulates during the winter. These snow-rich treeless ecosystems are affected by delayed snowmelt, causing shorter growing seasons. Snow-tolerant plants occupy the center of subarctic snowpatches   whereas black spruce trees grow at the margins. Snowpatches have shown sporadic expansion and shrinkage phases from tree establishment and mortality linked to climatic trends. Field surveys in the Subarctic of eastern Canada are showing an afforestation process occurring in snowpatches. The origin and nature of this afforestation were investigated based on the hypothesis that tree colonization and growth were closely associated with recent changes in climate.
2.   Snowpatches were categorized in three types based on border trees: forested, semi-forested and tundra-like. In eight randomly selected snowpatches of each type, snowpatch borders and areas covered by deciduous shrubs or trees were mapped and chionophilous plants and frost-associated soil disturbances were recorded. Radial (tree-ring  ) and vertical growth were measured on stems to evaluate the impact of climate and local factors on snowpatch black spruce populations.
3.   Two waves of spruce colonization occurred in all forested and semi-forested snowpatches in the 1960s and in the 1980s to present. Spruce establishment was more frequent and abundant in recent years, near the forest margins and on moss and barren seedbeds. Expanding shrub (dwarf birch) cover inhibited spruce seedling establishment. Tree establishment and growth were positively correlated with growing season temperature and negatively correlated with annual maximum snow depth. More recently established spruce seedlings exhibited faster vertical growth than those established in the 20thcentury.
4.   Synthesis: Due to warmer conditions and earlier snowmelt in eastern Canada, black spruce trees and dwarf birch shrubs are racing through subarctic snowpatches. This afforestation could change biodiversity in the Subarctic and affect watershed dynamics through a change in snowmelt pattern. Subarctic snowpatches are climate-sensitive ecosystems of the forest-tundra landscape, forming ideal biotopes for snow-tolerant, arctic-alpine species. Further tree encroachment in snowpatches in this century is potentially a threat to plant diversity, especially chionophilous species that have no corridors to migrate towards arctic ecosystems. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Complete data set<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data on snowpatch distribution, characteristics and detailed inventory of colonizing spruce seedlings.

Each transect comprises six 26 m x 4 m plots (104 m<sup>2</sup>), with 55-85 m of elevation between plots. Plots were established only in areas under full tree canopy to avoid disturbed habitats and wetland areas. Our focal species were selected given their high abundance and presence across most of the elevational gradient. The focal species were present in five plots per transect (absent at the highest elevation), covering an elevation gradient from 697 m to 951 m a.s.l. The geographic distance between plots varied from 123m for adjacent plots up 914m for the two most distant plots on different transects.</p>

<p>Each plot was divided into 26 2m × 2m subplots in which the number of flowers of <i>Trillium erectum</i> and <i>Erythronium americanum</i> was recorded approximately every 4 days throughout the flowering season for six years, 2013-2018 inclusive. Flowers were included in the count from the start of flower opening to the start of flower senescence (identified by signs of drying, wrinkling, or discoloration of petals or sepals). Since flower abundance decreased with elevation, for high-elevation plots (850 m and higher), we also recorded individuals within less than 2 m from the plots to obtain enough data to determine the flowering start, peak and end; the number of individuals was standardised to correspond to the density of individuals in an area of 104 m<sup>2</sup> (the area of one plot).</p> <p><b>Premise</b>: One of the best-documented ecological responses to climate warming involves temporal shifts of phenological events. However, we lack an understanding of how phenological responses to climate change vary among populations of the same species. Such variability has the potential to affect flowering synchrony among populations and hence the potential for gene flow.</p>

<p><b>Methods</b>: To test if an earlier start of the growing season affects the potential for gene flow among populations, we quantified the distributions of flowering times of two spring-flowering plants (<i>Trillium erectum</i> and <i>Erythronium americanum</i>) over six years along an elevation gradient. We developed a novel model-based metric of potential gene flow between pairs of populations to quantify the potential for pollen-mediated gene flow based on flowering phenology.</p>

<p><b>Results</b>: For both species investigated, earlier onset of spring led to greater separation of peak flowering dates across the elevation gradient. For <i>T. erectum</i>, but not <i>E. americanum</i>, this<i> </i>was also associated with a reduction in potential gene flow.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b>: Our study suggests that climate change could decrease gene flow via phenological separation among populations along climatic gradients.

To exclude natural pollinators, plants were bagged with fine nylon mesh before flowering. Each hand-pollinated flower was also emasculated before the stigma became receptive to prevent selfing. Pollen was transferred directly from donor flower anthers onto receptive stigmas until the stigmas were saturated. The date was selected to ensure that each flower was encountered at the onset of its stigmatic surface receptivity. 30 naturally open pollinated DMS plants were selected as the control (Bossuyt, 2007; Holme, James &amp; Hoffmann, 2008). </span></p>

In this study, the genetic diversity, performance and fitness of F1 progeny from crosses between the Damingshan (DMS) population of <i>Sinocalycanthus chinensis</i> and pollen parents from the Daleishan (DLS) and Longxushan (LXS) populations were examined. The DLS population has a relatively small population size, low genetic diversity and considerable geographical and genetic distances from the DMS population relative to the LXS population. Compared with naturally occurring seeds, DLS-sired seeds had the highest thousand-seed weight, starch content, fat content, germination rate, germination index and emergence rate, but the lowest protein content. Naturally occurring, open pollinated seeds had the lowest thousand-seed weight, starch content and fat content, but the highest protein content. Compared with natural F1 progeny, DMS × DLS seedlings had the highest genetic diversity, photosynthetic parameters and growth characteristics, except for leaf mass ratio and stem mass ratio. Under strong light, DMS × DLS seedlings exhibited a <i>F</i>v/<i>F</i>m value of 0.75, while the other two seedling types exhibited <i>F</i>v/<i>F</i>m values of 0.65. DLS-sired seeds had the most vigorous growth characteristics except for leaf mass ratio and stem mass ratio.

Morphological differences (size and shape) across habitats are common in lake fish where differences relate to two dominant contrasting habitats: the pelagic and littoral habitat. Repeated occurrence of littoral and pelagic morphs across multiple populations of several lake fish species has been considered as important evidence that polymorphism is adaptive in these systems. It has been suggested that these habitat-based polymorphic differences are due to the temporal stability of the differences between littoral and pelagic habitats. 2. Although streams are spatially heterogeneous, they are also more temporally dynamic than lakes and it is still an open question whether streams provide the environmental conditions that promote habitat-based polymorphism. We tested whether fish from riffle, run and pool habitats, respectively, differed consistently in their morphology. 3. Our test compared patterns of morphological variation (size and shape) in 10 fish species from the three stream habitat types in 36 separate streams distributed across three watersheds. 4. For most species, body size and shape (after controlling for body size) differed across riffle, run and pool habitats. Unlike many lake species, the nature of these differences was not consistent across species, possibly because these species use these habitat types in different ways. 5. Our results suggest that habitat-based polymorphism is an important feature also in stream-fishes despite the fact that streams are temporally variable in contrast to lake systems. Future research is required to assess whether the patterns of habitat-polymorphism encountered in streams have a genetic basis or they are simply the result of within generation phenotypic plasticity. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">DataSenayetal2014<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">In this file you will find partial warps and fish length for the 10 species studied.

Population genetic comparisons across time periods can help elucidate temporal changes in populations and the processes responsible for the changes. Bobcats (Lynx rufus) are wide-ranging carnivores and are currently increasing in abundance across an expanding range. Bobcat populations in New England have fluctuated in the past century in response to changes in their prey base, harvest pressure, and landscape development. We genotyped contemporary (2010–2017) and historic (1952–1964) bobcats from New England and Quebec, Canada at a suite of microsatellite loci and tested for differences in diversity, effective population size, and gene flow. Over 20 generations separated the sampling periods, and the intervening years were marked by drastic changes in land use and species management regimes. We found a general decrease in genetic diversity and differing population genetic structure through time. Effective population size decreased at the end of the historic period, coincident with a spike in harvest, but rebounded to greater numbers in the contemporary period. Our results suggest that bobcat populations in the region are robust, but development and range dynamics may play a significant role in population structure.

Short-range connectivity within habitat networks provides organisms access to spatially distributed resources, reduces local extinctions and increases recolonization of habitat fragments. Long-range connectivity across habitat networks facilitates annual migrations and climate-driven range shifts.
We present a method for identifying a multipurpose network of forest patches that promotes both short- and long-range connectivity. Our method uses both graph-theoretic analyses that quantify network connectedness and circuit-based analyses that quantify network traversability as the basis for identifying spatial conservation priorities on the landscape.  We illustrate our approach in the agroecosystem, bordered by the Laurentian and Appalachian mountain ranges, that surrounds the metropolis of Montreal, Canada. We established forest conservation priorities for the ovenbird, a Neotropical migrant, sensitive to habitat fragmentation that breeds in our study area. All connectivity analyses were based on the same empirically informed resistance surface for ovenbird, but habitat pixels that facilitated short- and long-range connectivity requirements had low spatial correlation. The trade-off between connectivity requirements in the final ranking of conservation priorities showed a pattern of diminishing returns such that beyond a threshold, additional conservation of long-range connectivity had decreased effectiveness on the conservation of short-range connectivity. Highest conservation priority was assigned to a series of stepping stone forest patches across the study area that promote traversability between the bordering mountain ranges and to a collection of small forest fragments scattered throughout the study area that provide connectivity within the agroecosystem.  Landscape connectivity is important for the ecology and genetics of populations threatened by climate change and habitat fragmentation. Our method has been illustrated as a means to conserve two critical dimensions of connectivity for a single species, but it is designed to incorporate a variety of connectivity requirements for many species. Our approach can be tailored to local, regional and continental conservation initiatives to protect essential species movements that will allow biodiversity to persist in a changing climate. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Landscape resistance for the ovenbird<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">This is a 30m resolution landscape resistance raster for the ovenbird.

Designing effective management strategies to resolve these conflicts requires understanding the species' resource use. Dietary analyses can shed light on the extent of consumption of agricultural crops and surrounding natural resources, as well as the potential relationship between diet and an individual's body condition and ultimately its fitness. We examined the dietary composition of the tropical magpie goose (<em>Anseranas semipalmata</em>), seasonally utilising a mixed natural-agricultural landscape of northern Australia. We used DNA metabarcoding of intestinal contents from hunted geese to reconstruct individual diets and evaluated body condition from morphometric measurements. We compared the relative contribution of agricultural and natural foods to dietary composition, and investigated how this contribution varied spatially, temporally, and among individuals that differed in body condition. We found that geese consumed both agricultural and naturally occuring plants assigned to at least 35 taxa. The most frequent and abundant taxa belonged to three families: Poaceae (grasses), Cyperaceae (sedges), and Anacardiaceae (mangoes). Dietary composition varied substantially among sampling sites and over time but not with body condition of geese. <em>Synthesis and applications</em>. We used a novel approach to investigate the diet of a waterbird perceived as problematic across an agricultural landscape in tropical Australia. We showed that individuals forage opportunistically, and that agricultural crops, while eaten, may not represent an essential part of geese diet across the study region. The knowledge acquired provides new insights into the species' foraging ecology offering clear alternatives for mitigating goose-agriculture interactions. Providing disturbance-free alternative foraging areas or minimising the attractiveness of targeted agricultural fields (e.g., shorter grass, alternative ground cover) may alleviate crop consumption while benefiting the species' long-term conservation. While also highlighting the limitations of DNA metabarcoding, our dietary study emphasises the potential of this methodology to improve our understanding of crop damage by wildlife, allowing effective evaluation of management requirements.</p> <p>Funding provided by: Hort Innovation<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000981<br>Award Number: MG15005</p><p>Funding provided by: Charles Darwin University<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001803<br>Award Number: </p><p>Funding provided by: Fonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et technologies<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003151<br>Award Number: </p> Agriculture; crop protection; Diet Analysis; DNA metabarcoding; human-wildlife conflicts; geese; <i>rbcL</i>; Wildlife Management","2022-08-05","3,7,8","location","no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","no","zenodo"

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-bottom:11px;"">The dataset integrates data from inventories conducted during 1990-2019 period throughout the Lake Duparquet Research and Teaching Forest (LDRTF), located in the balsam fir - white birch bioclimatic domain of Québec (Canada), where a dozen of large wildfires occurred since 1760 (Bergeron 1991). Within the LDRTF site, the EASTERN BOREAL MIXEDWOODS CANADA data have been collected in three main subsets that cover different study objectives that contribute to a better understanding of post-fire stand successional dynamics:</p>

<ol>
	<li style=""text-align:justify;"">
<u> LDRTF-TRANSECTS:</u> These transects represent a network of 596 quadrats that covers the stands originated from eight wildfires that occurred from 1760 to 1964 (1760, 1797, 1823, 1847, 1870, 1916, 1944 and 1964). The original idea of establishing the quadrats in 1990-1991 was to study the compositional and structural variability of post-fire stands and changes over time, first with a chronosequence analysis (Bergeron and Dubuc 1989) and then by a stand-reconstruction approach (Bergeron 2000). The other objective of establishing the plots were to study the interaction between post fire stand composition and secondary disturbances (Kneeshaw and Bergeron 1998). The quadrats were re-sampled in 2009 and were used in several studies, for example for parametrizing the SORTIE-ND forest simulator to simulate the natural successional dynamics of post-fire stands in LDRTF over long periods, both in presence and in absence of natural and anthropogenic disturbances (Poulin et al. 2007, Poulin and Messier 2008, Leduc and Coates 2013, Bose et al. 2015, Maleki et al. 2020).</li>
	<li style=""text-align:justify;margin-bottom:11px;"">
<u>LDRTF-SEEDLING_PLOTS:</u> In each post-fire stand (1760, 1797, 1823, 1847, 1870, 1916, 1944 and 1964) a 400 m<sup>2</sup> plot was stablished in 1997 to observe annual seedling recruitment and mortality in 16 one-m<sup>2</sup> subplots located near the plot borders.</li>
	<li style=""text-align:justify;margin-bottom:11px;"">
<u>LDRTF-HECTARES:</u> In six of the post-fire stands (1760, 1823, 1847, 1870, 1916 and 1944) a one-hectare permanent plot was first established in 1991 and re-measured in 4-6 years intervals. One of the goals to establish this data was to study the spatial patterns, age structure and growth of species in each stand (Park et al. 2005).</li>
</ol> <p>A combination of wildfires and defoliating insect outbreaks play an important role in the natural successional dynamics of North American boreal forests, which, in the long term, change the post-disturbance composition and structure of forest stands. After stand-replacing disturbances (mainly wildfires), early successional hardwoods typically dominate the affected areas in boreal forests. Provided sufficient time following disturbances, the increasing recruitment of mid- to late-successional softwoods as well as the mortality of hardwoods gradually change forest composition from hardwoods to admixtures of hardwood-conifer species and conifer-dominated stands in mid and late successional stages, respectively. Such mixed woods are abundant across the southern Canadian boreal forest. In boreal Canada, mixed woods are the most structurally heterogeneous forest ecosystems, are highly productive, and form an important source of timber supply. Here we present the EASTERN BOREAL MIXEDWOODS CANADA dataset, which documents the changes in composition and structure of stands originating from eight successive wildfires representing a chronosequence of 249 years in eastern Canada. This dataset has been used in several different projects to study and model the influence of natural (e.g., insect outbreaks) and anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., harvesting) on the dynamics of post-fire stands. The data covers a high range of variability in stand composition and structure, explained by species establishment, dominance and mixture. It thus constitutes a useful source of information to trace the dynamics of the main boreal tree species of eastern north America, from their establishment to their replacement at different spatial scales (e.g., from stand to landscape level).</p> <p>The README.txt file contains the description of all tables and variables in the data.</p>

Diapausing stage CVs sampled in deep waters of the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary (Québec, Canada) in late-September 2009 were monitored for 4 months under controlled laboratory conditions. CVs and newly moulted adults were analyzed for δ13C and δ15N signatures as well as lipid, carbon and nitrogen content. Lipids were extracted in half of the samples to compare δ13C of individuals with and without lipids and to evaluate the accuracy of mass balance correction models for δ13C under lipid influence. Lipid content generally decreased with time for both species, which was reflected in an increase of δ13C values of CVs but a constant δ13C in newly moulted adults. Accordingly, lipid extraction resulted in an increase of δ13C in CVs and adults. The mean δ13C signature of lipid-extracted individuals remained constant through the time for CVs of both species and for C. finmarchicus adults. δ15N signatures of individuals increased after lipid extraction, but this did not result in a constant value over time, suggesting that several endogenous metabolic processes affected nitrogen isotopic content. The accuracy of the mass balance model differed between species and stages, suggesting that lipid extraction should always be performed prior to applying mathematical corrections. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Stable isotopes dynamics of diapausing Calanus spp..

The present study was restricted to 49 lakes with complete data for asuite of morphometric, physical, chemical, and biotic variables, including three trophic levels (phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish communities). Plankton and fish communities were sampled during July and August 1982, thus capturing a key period of anthropogenic acidification and consequently one of the strongest spatial gradients in natural and anthropogenic lake acidity experienced in the region. To minimize the effect of the seasonal development on plankton communities, sampling started at successive times in the eight regions following the west-to-east geographic and climatic axis gradient over a period of 1 month. Phytoplankton species counts (87 species across all sites) were expressed as cells per millilitre; zooplankton species counts (34 species) were expressed as numbers of individuals per cubic metre and converted to biomass (milligrams per cubic metre) using specific dry mass relationships; fish counts (18 species) were expressed in abundances (catch per unit effort). Environmental variables examined provided information on the geography (latitude, longitude, and altitude), morphometry (lake and catchment areas, lake order, maximum and relative depths, length, width, and volume), and water quality (pH, ions, metals, alkalinity, alkalinity: sulfate ratio, organic and inorganic carbon, conductivity, transparency, colour, and the morphoedaphic index) of each study site. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p> <p>Environmental heterogeneity plays a fundamental role in driving species distributions by, for one, fostering niche dimensionality. Within lake ecosystems, species distributions and concordance patterns are driven by both local and regional heterogeneity, though their relative importance across trophic levels has rarely been explored. We developed a statistical framework to compare responses of taxa from different trophic levels to abiotic factors and determine how thisaffected multi-trophic network structures.In particular, we used multi-species concordance modelling (Concordance Analysis and RV coefficient) to determine species associations and correlations within and among three trophic levels (phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish communities sampled across 49 southern Québeclakes, covering eight hydrological regions). We then used Multiple Factor Analysis, Latent Variable Modelling and Local Contributions of sites to Beta Diversity to assess the relative importance of major environmental gradients in structuring species co-responses and species interaction turnover across the landscape. Our analyses confirmed that concordant species within each trophic level varied jointly or segregated into different pelagic food webs in Québec lakes where important acidification and eutrophication took place. Somekeynote species were indicators of different food web compartments and distinguished groups of lakes along multiple environmental niche dimensions. Among the three trophic levels examined, zooplankton depicted the highest proportion of species concordance and appeared to act as a trophic linkage between phytoplankton and fish. Ultimately, the losses or gains in species richness and species interactions were strongly driven by environmental gradients.This study provides for the first time a combined analysis of the effects of environmental heterogeneity on ecological communities belonging to three trophic levels sampled near simultaneously across an 800 km broad lacustrine landscape. The new framework developed in this study has a great potential to better understand the complex response of aquatic ecosystems in a world increasingly affected by multiple, cumulative stressors.</p>

Pathogens can accumulate on invasive plants over time, which could lead to population declines. The time required for these dynamics to occur is unknown and seldom addressed. Furthermore, no study has assessed plant-soil feedback while characterising plant pathogen and mutualist root fungal communities in the context of invasion time. 2. We used a plant-soil feedback study and 454 pyrosequencing to investigate pathogen accumulation over 100 years on a highly invasive plant in eastern North America that shows localised declines, Vincetoxicum rossicum (Apocynaceae). 3. We collected soil from five sites representing each of four invasion periods of V. rossicum across Ontario, Canada (old, ~100 years; intermediate, 50-60 years; young, &lt;12 years; and uninvaded), and grew V. rossicum in these soils in a glasshouse study. Our hypothesis was that plants grown in soils invaded for longer periods of time would experience less positive feedbacks compared to those grown in more recently invaded or uninvaded soils. We collected roots of V. rossicum from the invasion periods and performed 454 pyrosequencing targeting fungi. We hypothesised that the abundance and richness of fungi that are known plant pathogens would be higher in roots from older invasions compared to more recent invasions. 4. Contrasting with our hypothesis, V. rossicum experienced overall growth promotion due to soil biota, regardless of invasion period. Vincetoxicum rossicum roots were colonised by a large number of fungal taxa, including many known plant pathogens or mutualistic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. However, we found no evidence of pathogen accumulation in older invaded sites in terms of species composition, richness or abundance. 5. Synthesis: Our consistent results in the glasshouse and the field highlight the strength of combining high-throughput sequencing data with plant-soil feedback experiments. We showed that the roots of Vincetoxicum rossicum (Apocynaceae) were colonised by many fungal taxa, but found no evidence for changes in plant growth or accumulation of fungal pathogens with longer invasion time. High pathogen loads may not lead to concurrent declines in invasive plants. Plant invasions, as demonstrated by V. rossicum, may be unpredictable in their ability to accumulate pathogens capable of leading to population declines. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Fungal colonisation<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">This file contains data for roots hyphal colonisation, based on roots that have been cleared and stained with ink-vinegar.

To date, our knowledge of genotypic variation and evolution has largely been acquired by means of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) analyses. Until recently, the adaptive role of structural variants (SVs) and particularly that of CNVs has been overlooked in wild populations, partly due to their challenging identification. Here, we document the usefulness of Rapture, a derived reduced‐representation shotgun sequencing approach, to detect and investigate copy number variants (CNVs) alongside SNPs in American lobster (<i>Homarus americanus</i>) populations. We conducted a comparative study to examine the potential role of SNPs and CNVs in local adaptation by sequencing 1,141 lobsters from 21 sampling sites within the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, which experiences the highest yearly thermal variance of the Canadian marine coastal waters. Our results demonstrated that CNVs account for higher genetic differentiation than SNP markers. Contrary to SNPs, for which no significant genetic–environment association was found, 48 CNV candidates were significantly associated with the annual variance of sea surface temperature, leading to the genetic clustering of sampling locations despite their geographic separation. Altogether, we provide a strong empirical case that CNVs putatively contribute to local adaptation in marine species and unveil stronger spatial signal of population structure than SNPs. Our study provides the means to study CNVs in nonmodel species and highlights the importance of considering structural variants alongside SNPs to enhance our understanding of ecological and evolutionary processes shaping adaptive population structure.</p> <p><strong>Raw VCF consisted of 44374 unfiltered SNPs</strong><br>

Increasing reliance on certain agricultural practices is thought to have led to an overall reduction in insect abundance that negatively affects aerial insectivore fitness. The relationship between prey availability and the fitness of insectivores may thus vary with the extent of agricultural intensity. It is therefore imperative to quantify the strength and direction of these associations. Here we used data from an 11-year study monitoring the breeding of Tree Swallows (<em>Tachycineta bicolor</em>) and the availability of Diptera (their main prey) across a gradient of agricultural intensification in southern Québec, Canada. This gradient was characterized by a shift in agricultural production, whereby landscapes composed of forage and pastures represented less agro-intensive landscapes and those focusing on large-scale arable row crop monocultures, such as corn (<em>Zea mays</em>) or soybean (<em>Glycine max</em>) that are innately associated with significant mechanization and agro-chemical inputs, represented more agro-intensive landscapes. We evaluated the landscape characteristics affecting prey availability, and how this relationship influences the fledging success, duration of the nestling period, fledgling body mass, and wing length as these variables are known to influence the population dynamics of this species. Diptera availability was greatest within predominately forested landscapes, while within landscapes dominated by agriculture, it was marginally greater in less agro-intensive areas. Of the measured fitness and body condition proxies, both fledging success and nestling body mass were positively related to prey availability. The impact of prey availability varied across the agricultural gradient as fledging success improved with increasing prey levels within forage landscapes yet declined in more agro-intensive landscapes. Finally, after accounting for prey availability, fledging success was lowest, nestling periods were the longest, and wing length of fledglings were shortest within more agro-intensive landscapes. Our results highlight the interacting roles that aerial insect availability and agricultural intensification have on the fitness of aerial insectivores, and by extension how food availability may interact with other aspects of breeding habitats to influence the population dynamics of predators.</p>","2022-02-07","3,4,6",NA,"yes","L","repository",".csv","site IDs","not given","no","diptera (in general.

Stocked lake trout, originating from a genetically distinct ecotype, exhibited a more variable thermal niche, with some individuals consistently using warmer habitat (10.4 ± 1°C) than local fish.

<p>This dataset comprises of parasitoids caught in 2016 at 19 Arctic and Sub-Arctic localities during two consecutive six-day-long trapping periods aimed to take place during the flowering peak of the mountain avens (Dryas spp.).  Each location had three to four trapping sites (A-D) in Dryas heath type habitats, each with ten 5cm by 4.5cm white sticky traps cut out from sticky board (Barrettine Environmental, UK [product no longer available]). Sticky traps were embedded in growths of Dryas spp.</p>

<p>The parasitoids were subsequently picked of off the sticky traps, their whole DNA was extracted and half of their Cytochrome Oxidase I barcode region was amplified using Primers B-F and HCO. The processing of samples was done in three parts (Data1, Data2, Data2) with slightly different methodology. See the supplementary information of the recommended publication for more details. Datasets were sequenced at the Helsinki Functional Genomics Unit (FuGU) in two separate MiSeq v3 2x300bp runs (Data1 and Data2). Additionally, a set of samples from a specific site (Zackenberg) were sequenced as part of larger set at the FIMM Technology Centre in a HiSeq2500 2x250bp run (Data3).</p>

<p>Additionally, Dryas flower count, flowering phenology and flower damage by insect herbivores was recorded at the start, after a week (day 6) and in the end (day 12). These counts were done in 3 to 5 1/4 square meter monitoring plots per trapping site. Microclimate was recorded at one trapping site per locality using Lascar EL-USB-2 tempeerature and air humidity loggers under a small white plastic dome at ~ 10 cm height.</p>

<p>2. Methods for processing the data: </p>

<p>Initially, paired-end reads were merged and trimmed for quality using 32-bit usearch version 11 (Edgar 2010) with the command 'fastq_mergepairs'. Primers were removed using software cutadapt version 1.14 (Martin 2011) with 15% mismatch rate. The reads were then collapsed into unique sequences (singletons removed) with command 'fastx_uniques'. The subsequent clustering steps differed slightly for different data sets, due to the origin of the data (MiSeq vs. HiSeq2500), as follows. For Data1 and Data2, the newly-collapsed unique sequences were cleaned of chimeras using command 'uchime_denovo' and clustered into 96% OTUs (OTU = Operational Taxonomical Unit) using command 'cluster_size' using USEARCH. The choice of 96% clustering threshold was based on empirical optimization, considering both the rapid genetic divergence in CO1, as well as potential sequencing errors. For Data3, the unique sequences were denoised (i.e., chimeras were removed) and reads were clustered into ZOTUs (= 'zero-radius OTU') with command 'unoise3' using USEARCH version 11. These ZOTUs do not practically differ from traditional clustering of OTUs (which are based on pre-set percentage threshold), but according to Edgar and Flyvbjerg (2015), the UNOISE algorithm performs better for certain heterogenous data sets in (i) removing chimeras, (ii) PhiX sequences and (iii) Illumina artefacts. Then OTUs and ZOTUs were mapped back to the original trimmed reads with command 'usearch_global' ('search_exact' for Data3) to establish the total number of reads in each sample using 64-bit software vsearch (Rognes et al. 2016). Overall, we were able to map 25,673,920 reads (Data1: 4,261,291; Data2: 12,095,141; Data3: 9,317,488) to our original samples. These reads were subject to further filtering: from each sample, each OTU/ZOTU with less reads than 2% of the total reads in that sample were discarded, which also cleared most of the extraction and PCR negative controls. Finally, samples producing less than 37 reads (a threshold chosen by analysing the data as a whole) were removed from the subsequent analysis.</p>

<p>The taxonomic assignations were initially done independently for each dataset (using identical criteria), but the final assignations were carried out using the whole, combined (Data1+Data2+Data3) dataset. The OTUs/ZOTUs were initially identified into genus-level using the RDP classifier with a very recently constructed COI-RDP database v3.2 (with 60% probability threshold for genus-level assignation) following Porter and Hajibabaei (2018). In cases where the database was clearly insufficient to reach a genus-level assignation, we used local BLAST against all the retrieved COI sequences in BOLD (Altschul et al. 1990; Ratnasingham and Hebert 2007) and chose the most probable match. Taxonomic information for remaining hits was retrieved manually from BOLD using BIN code (from earlier steps) or the actual OTU/ZOTU sequence. Finally, identifications were checked against our preliminary identification notes taken at the beginning of DNA extraction, and potentially false assignations (due to for example contamination in certain steps, or clear errors in the database) were either removed or assigned to the likely correct out/ZOTU.</p>

<p>As the end result of all the bioinformatic steps, we arrived at a list of 460 parasitoid taxa (listed in OTU_info.csv Those dataset specific OTUs which were collapsed to one in the merging of the datasets are also listed in this file).</p> <p>Climatic impacts are especially pronounced in the Arctic, which as a region is warming twice as fast as the rest of the globe. Here, we investigate how mean climatic conditions and rates of climatic change impact parasitoid insect communities in 16 localities across the Arctic. We focus on parasitoids in a wide-spread habitat, <em>Dryas</em> heathlands, and describe parasitoid community composition in terms of larval host use (i.e. parasitoid use of herbivorous Lepidoptera versus pollinating Diptera) and functional groups (i.e. parasitoids adhering to an idiobiont versus koinobiont lifestyle). Of the latter, we expect idiobionts to be generally associated with poorer tolerance to cold temperatures. To further test our findings, we assess whether similar climatic variables are associated with host abundances in a 22-year time series from Northeast Greenland. We find that sites which have experienced a temperature rise in summer while retaining cold winters to be dominated by parasitoids of Lepidoptera, with the pattern reversed among the parasitoids of Diptera. The rate of summer temperature rise is further associated with higher levels of herbivory, suggesting higher availability of lepidopteran hosts and changes in ecosystem functioning. We also detect a matching signal over time, as higher summer temperatures, coupled with cold early winter soils, are related to high herbivory by lepidopteran larvae, and to declines in the abundance of dipteran pollinators. Collectively, our results suggest that in parts of the warming Arctic, <em>Dryas</em> is being simultaneously exposed to increased herbivory and reduced pollination. Our findings point to potential drastic and rapid consequences of climate change on multitrophic-level community structure and on ecosystem functioning and highlight the value of collaborative systematic sampling effort.</p> <p>The included README_PanArcticParasitods.txt file contains detailed metadata on all included variables.</p>

<p>There are some missing data e.g.:</p>

<p>In the in situ microclimate measurements misising values are denoted with, NA</p>

<p>In the parasitoid data, samples which failed to to produce parasitoid reads are marked with NA.</p>

<p>In the Dryas data, two localities have their data data missing, and are not included in this table, where as one site Kobbejford had no <em>Dryas</em> and has counts of Loiseleuria procumbens as a phenological indicator in stead. This is marked in the datapoint notes.</p>

<p>Concerning OTUs: Our OTUs are based on only a half of the CO1 barcode region and we used a quite wide clustering treshold of 96%. Also the clustering was done globally on a dataset containing closely related species from different continents. While this works well for the intended purpose of looking at functional group dominance at site level, the taxonomic resolution is inadequate for applications requiring true species level information. In such occasiton we encourage contacting the corresponding author. The DNA extracts are stored at the Department of Agricultural Sciences of the University of Helsinki, Finland.</p>

The sorghum data were generated from sorghum lines from the US National Plant Germplasm System grown in Urbana, IL (Fernandes <i>et al.</i> 2017) and trait values were averaged over two blocks for this study. The soybean data were generated from the SoyNAM population containing recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from 40 biparental populations (Xavier <i>et al.</i> 2016). The white spruce data were obtained from the SmartForests project team, using a SNP-chip developed by Quebec Ministry of Forest Wildlife and Parks (Beaulieu <i>et al.</i> 2014)<sub>.</sub> Switchgrass phenotypic (Lipka <i>et al.</i> 2014) and genotypic (Evans <i>et al.</i> 2017) data were generated from the Northern Switchgrass Association Panel (Evans <i>et al.</i> 2015) which contains clones or genotypes from 66 diverse upland switchgrass populations.</p>

<p style=""text-indent:0.5in;"">The genotype data was obtained in the form of biallelic SNPs with missing marker data already dropped or imputed by the original authors. Marker calls were converted when necessary to [-1,0,1] corresponding to [aa, Aa, AA] where A was either the reference or the most common allele. Genome locations of maize SNPs were converted from assembly AGPv2 to AGPv4, with AGPv2 SNPs that did not map to AGPv4 being removed, leaving 332,178 markers for the maize analysis. Phenotype values were normalized between 0 and 1. Lines with missing phenotypic value for any of the three traits were removed.</p> <p>The usefulness of genomic prediction in crop and livestock breeding programs has prompted efforts to develop new and improved genomic prediction algorithms, such as artificial neural networks and gradient tree boosting. However, the performance of these algorithms has not been compared in a systematic manner using a wide range of datasets and models. Using data of 18 traits across six plant species with different marker densities and training population sizes, we compared the performance of six linear and six non-linear algorithms. First, we found that hyperparameter selection was necessary for all non-linear algorithms and that feature selection prior to model training was critical for artificial neural networks when the markers greatly outnumbered the number of training lines. Across all species and trait combinations, no one algorithm performed best, however predictions based on a combination of results from multiple algorithms (i.e. ensemble predictions) performed consistently well. While linear and non-linear algorithms performed best for a similar number of traits, the performance of non-linear algorithms vary more between traits. Although artificial neural networks did not perform best for any trait, we identified strategies (i.e. feature selection, seeded starting weights) that boosted their performance to near the level of other algorithms. Our results highlight the importance of algorithm selection for the prediction of trait values.</p>  Genomic selection; Genomic prediction","2019-10-04","3,6",NA,"yes","X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"white spruce",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA","NA","G3 Genes","https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.119.400498","no","zenodo"

Mast seeding is perhaps the most common type of resource pulse that occurs in terrestrial ecosystems, is characterized by the synchronous and highly variable production of seed crops by a population of perennial plants, is widespread both taxonomically and geographically, and is often associated with nutrient scarcity. The rare production of abundant seed crops (mast events) that are orders of magnitude greater than crops during low seed years leads to high reproductive success in seed consumers and has cascading impacts in ecosystems. Although it has been suggested that mast seeding is potentially synchronized at continental scales, studies are largely constrained to local areas covering tens to hundreds of kilometres. Furthermore, summer temperature, which acts as a cue for mast seeding, shows patterns at continental scales manifested as a juxtaposition of positive and negative anomalies that have been linked to irruptive movements of boreal seed-eating birds. Here, we show a breakdown in synchrony of mast seeding patterns across space, leading to asynchrony at the continental scale. In an analysis of synchrony for a transcontinental North America tree species spanning distances of greater than 5,200 km, we found that mast seeding patterns were significantly asynchronous at distances of greater than 2,000 km apart (all <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Other studies have shown declines in synchrony across distance, but not asynchrony. Spatiotemporal variation in summer temperatures at the continental scale drives patterns of synchrony in mast seeding, and we anticipate that this affects the spatial dynamics of numerous seed-eating communities, from insects to small mammals to the large-scale migration patterns of boreal seed-eating birds.</p> <p>See ReadMe files and information in the methods section of LaMontagne et al. 2020.

<p>The study was conducted in 27 farms growing fruit or vegetable crops in Eastern Ontario and the Outaouais region of Québec, Canada (map of sites in Figure S1). Farms planning to grow cucurbit crops were chosen initially for inclusion because we wished to focus on pollinator‐dependent, late‐season crops; however, many farms were not able to grow cucurbits due to drought conditions experienced throughout the region. To maximize independence among farm sites (i.e., to minimize the chance that an individual bee could move between farms), chosen farms were 4–211 km apart. Across all farm sites, 102 locations were sampled for bees and floral resource abundance (as described below), with one to six locations per farm, depending on the number of distinct land patches in which resource‐providing flowers were present, and when permission was given from landowners. Sampling locations within patches of land were selected based on the estimated location of the patch's centre or, if the patch was over 25 m wide, was located at least 10 m from an edge. In three patches wider than 25 m, sampling locations less than 10 m from the edge were used due to a complete absence of flowers in bloom in the centre. The distance between sampling locations within a farm ranged from 3.8 m to 1,040 m. Sites were visited in rotation over four time periods during one season in 2016: the first took place in late spring, between May 20 and June 10 (n = 38 sampling locations), the second in early summer, from June 10 to July 4 (n = 33), the third in mid‐summer, from July 5 to August 1 (n = 37), and the fourth in late summer, from August 1 to September 1 (n = 39). If sampling locations contained open flowers during more than one sampling period, the same location was sampled in multiple time periods.</p>

<p>The composition of the landscape within 250, 500, and 750 m radii of each sampling location was quantified to estimate landscape‐scale floral resource abundance. The 250–750 m scale has been found in previous studies to be the range at which non‐<em>Apis</em> bees respond to landscape structure (Steffan‐Dewenter et al., 2002), and 500 m was chosen as an intermediate spatial scale. Sampling locations within the same farm site (and with overlapping radii at the 750 m scale) were not treated as independent (see Statistical analysis). Within a 750 m radius around each sampling location, the boundaries between land patches were manually digitized in QGIS version 2.18.7, using both waypoints taken on‐site with a Trimble® Juno SD handheld GPS unit (Trimble Navigation Limited), and from Google Earth and Bing Aerial satellite imagery.</p>

<p>Each land patch was then categorized by the type of land‐use (hereafter, ""land type""), through ground‐truthing and raster imagery from Agriculture and Agri‐Food Canada's (AAFC) 2016 Annual Crop Inventory. Land types fell into three categories: non‐resource land, resource‐providing land, and unknown land (see Table S1 for detailed descriptions of each land type). Non‐resource land was defined as any area that did not provide floral resources, which included crops with exclusively wind‐pollinated flowers and crops with anecdotal or no evidence of bees collecting resources from flowers. Urban and developed land, which comprised approximately 8.5% of all area surrounding sampling locations, was also included in non‐resource land; although residential gardens may provide floral resources for bees, the amount is inconsistent over time and space (Cane, 2005; Matteson et al., 2008) and appeared in our study to be highly variable across locations. Furthermore, other components of urban and developed land (e.g., pavement, mown lawns) are often devoid of floral resources. Resource‐providing land was defined as land areas that provided floral resources for bees at some point during the season and was categorized into 14 different land types (Table S1). Sampling locations were located only within resource‐providing land, and at least one of each resource‐providing land type was sampled during each time period. Unknown land was comprised of areas where we could not determine the crop grown (2.3% of all area surrounding sampling locations); hedgerow (1.8%); crop land where potentially resource‐providing crops were grown, but floral resources were not measured (0.7%); and soybean (10%), which is of uncertain value as a floral resource for bees. There is some anecdotal evidence for cross‐pollination by honey bees resulting in increased soybean yields (Ahrent &amp; Caviness, 1994; Erickson et al., 1978), and 29 species of wild bees (including eight of the species observed in this study) have been found visiting soybean in Delaware, Wisconsin, and Missouri, USA (Rust et al., 1980). However, many varieties of soybean are cleistogamous, or self‐fertilize before flowers open, and insect pollination of Ontario‐grown varieties is not expected to increase yields (OMAFRA, 2015).</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:bold;""><strong>Bee observations</strong></span></p>

<p>Bee observation methods were adapted from frequently used pollinator surveying designs (Alarcón et al., 2008; Gibson et al., 2011; Memmott, 1999). At each sampling location, a transect was set up to survey bee activity within a 30 m × 4 m area (89 transects); a 30 m × 2 m area was surveyed when only one crop row (&lt; 4 m wide) was present (eight transects); and 25 m × 4 m (one transect) or 24 m × 4m areas (four transects) were surveyed when crop rows were shorter than 30 m. Bee observations occurred over 1 min per 4 m2 of transect intervals by slowly walking the length of the transect. The shaded and unshaded temperature, maximum wind speed, and average wind speed were recorded for at least 1 min using a Kestrel® 2000 Pocket Weather® Meter (Nielsen‐Kellerman) held at approximately 1.5 m above ground preceding each observation period. If there was a noticeable change in conditions during the observation period, temperature and wind speed were recorded again at the end of the period and averages were recorded. All bee observations were conducted when shaded temperatures were above 11.9°C (mean ± SD = 25.3°C ± 4°C), average wind speeds were below 1.9 m/s, and maximum wind speeds were below 4 m/s.</p>

<p>During observation periods, all occurrences of bees visiting open flowers were recorded by two observers, standing on either side of the transect width, and recording all visits within 2 m each. A visit was counted when a bee was seen contacting sexual organs of an entomophilous flower or was probing a flower for nectar. All visited flowers were identified to genus (9 out of 77 taxa) or species (68 out of 77 taxa), and bees were identified on the wing to genus or species. When identification was not possible on the wing, observations were paused and both observers attempted to catch the bee to take a photograph from inside a glass vial or to collect it as a voucher (79 specimens total). Vouchers were then identified to species or genus and are stored in the Forrest laboratory's collection at the University of Ottawa (Ottawa, ON, Canada). Overall, 82% of bees were identified to species, 17% to genus, 0.1% to family, and 1% as Anthophila. The full list of bee taxa can be found in Table S2.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:bold;"">Floral resources</span></p>

<p>Floral density was recorded at each sampling location, using three quadrats of 1.5 m × 1.5 m. Quadrats were placed in random locations within the same transect used for bee observations, immediately following the observation period. If no open flowers were present in all three quadrat locations, an additional location was randomly selected and the mean count across the four quadrats was recorded. Within a quadrat, the number of open flowers was counted for each nongraminoid species encountered; for species with many‐flowered inflorescences, five individuals were haphazardly selected, and the number of flowers was counted on a randomly selected inflorescence. The mean number of flowers per inflorescence for many‐flowered species was then multiplied by the number of inflorescences in a quadrat to obtain the number of flowers per quadrat. In members of the Asteraceae family, capitula were treated as single flowers (see Table S3 for descriptions of floral units used for counts of each species). For 29 out of 96 species encountered, the number of flowers per inflorescence was obtained from either literature sources or digital images of herbarium specimens because of the large number of flowers encountered in the field or because (in a few cases) the species was inadvertently overlooked in the field (see Table S3 for literature values for each species).</p>

<p>To estimate the amount of floral resources (nectar and pollen) provided by a species, floral dimensions were measured on five haphazardly selected individuals of each species. The length and width of the receptacle (or capitulum in Asteraceae species) were measured at right angles to each other, as well as the height from the receptacle to the end of the longest sexual organ (stamen or pistil); in species with sexual organs completely hidden within a corolla, height was measured from the receptacle to the end of the corolla. Measurements were made using calipers and were rounded to the nearest 1 mm. Thirty‐one of 96 species were not measured in the field, and floral measurements were instead obtained from literature sources or digital images of herbarium specimens (see Table S3 for measurements and literature sources for each species). Floral measurements were used to calculate both the surface area of flowers (<i>A </i>= π<i>ab</i>) and the volume of flowers (<i>V</i> = π<i>abh</i>), where a is the semi‐major axis, or half the length or width (whichever was longest) of a flower's receptacle or capitulum, b is the semi‐minor axis, or half the length or width (whichever was shortest) of a flower's receptacle or capitulum, and h is the height of a flower or inflorescence (Figure 2c and Table S3).</p>

<p>To determine which measurement of floral dimensions was the best proxy for floral resource amount, literature searches for daily nectar sugar mass (µg/day) and pollen volume (in µl/flower) were conducted for all flowering species encountered; these measurements have been previously used to assess floral resources available to pollinators (Baude et al., 2016; Hicks et al., 2016). Literature sources that provided counts of pollen grains per flower and volumes of individual pollen grains were used to calculate an estimate of pollen volume per flower for species for which we could not find measurements of total pollen volume. Nectar sugar mass was obtained for 46 species and pollen volume for 33 species of the 96 encountered (see Tables S4–S5 for full species lists). Pearson correlations between nectar sugar mass or pollen volume and the length, width, height, surface area, and volume measurements of each species (all variables log‐transformed to approximate normal distributions) were used to determine which floral dimension could best estimate the amount of floral resources. In addition, to determine whether the source of floral volume measurements (literature, in‐field measurements, or combination of both; see Table S3) influenced the relationship between floral volume and either nectar or pollen, we ran ANCOVAs on daily nectar sugar mass and pollen volume as functions of floral volume, measurement source, and their interaction. The interaction was nonsignificant for both nectar (F<sub>2,40</sub> = 0.82, p = .45) and pollen (F<sub>2,28</sub> = 0.18, p = .83), indicating that it was reasonable to combine data sources.</p>

<p>For all bee genera other than <em>Peponapis</em>, the abundance of floral resources in the landscape surrounding each sampling location was calculated by determining the mean floral resource value per flower of each species and multiplying this value by the count of each flower in a quadrat. <em>Peponapis</em> collect pollen exclusively from squash (<em>Cucurbita</em> spp.; Hurd et al., 1974), and we only observed <em>Peponapis</em> visiting squash and cucumber (<em>Cucumis</em> <em>sativus</em>) flowers (both Cucurbitaceae). Therefore, in models of <em>Peponapis</em> visits, the abundance of floral resources in the landscape surrounding each sampling location was calculated from the mean floral resource value per squash or cucumber flower. While other bee genera such as <em>Andrena</em> likely included some oligolectic (pollen‐specialist) species, we included all rewarding plant taxa in calculations of floral resources for genera other than <em>Peponapis</em>, as oligolectic species would make up a much smaller proportion of the total than in <em>Peponapis</em>. Furthermore, collectively, all oligolectic species within other genera would likely be specialized on pollen from multiple taxonomic groups, rather than a single family as in <em>Peponapis</em>. The mean abundance of floral resources per 1 m2 was then calculated across quadrats for each transect, and the median of the transect‐level values was calculated for each land type during each time period. This number was then multiplied by the total area of each land type within 250, 500, and 750 m around a sampling location to obtain an estimate of the total floral resources at a given spatial scale during a given time period.</p> <p>The contribution of wild insects to crop pollination is becoming increasingly important as global demand for crops dependent on animal pollination increases. If wild insect populations are to persist in agricultural landscapes, there must be sufficient resources over time and space. The temporal, within‐season component of floral resource availability has rarely been investigated, despite growing recognition of its likely importance for pollinator populations. Here, we examined the visitation rates of common bee genera and the spatiotemporal availability of floral resources in agroecosystems over one season to determine whether local wild bee activity was limited by landscape floral resource abundance, and if so, whether it was limited by the present or past abundance of landscape floral resources. Visitation rates and landscape floral resources were measured in 27 agricultural sites in Ontario and Québec, Canada, across four time periods and three spatial scales. Floral resources were determined based on species‐specific floral volume measurements, which we found to be highly correlated with published measurements of nectar sugar mass and pollen volume. Total floral volume at varying spatial scales predicted visits for commonly observed bee genera. We found <i>Lasioglossum</i> and <i>Halictus</i> visits were highest in landscapes that provided either a stable or increasing amount of floral resources over the season. <i>Andrena</i> visits were highest in landscapes with high floral resources at the start of the season, and <i>Bombus</i> visits appeared to be positively related to greater cumulative seasonal abundance of floral resources. These findings together suggest the importance of early‐season floral resources to bees. <i>Megachile</i> visits were negatively associated with the present abundance of floral resources, perhaps reflecting pollinator movement or dilution. Our research provides insight into how seasonal fluctuations in floral resources affect bee activity and how life history traits of bee genera influence their responses to food availability within agroecosystems.</p> <p>Guezen_Forrest_shapefiles_2021 folder: See ReadMe file included.</p>

Eight-week-old mice were anaesthetized with 1.5-3.0% isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (Kopf Instruments). A scalpel was used to open an incision along the midline to expose the skull. After performing a craniotomy, 40 nl of one of the viral vectors listed above at a titer of 2*1012 particles/ml was injected per site (PMd, amv dlPAG) using a 10 μl nanofil syringe (World Precision Instruments) at 0.08 μl/min. The syringe was coupled to a 33-gauge beveled needle, and the bevel was placed to face the anterior side of the animal. The syringe was slowly retracted 20 minutes after the start of the infusion. Mice received unilateral viral infusion and fiber optic cannula implantation. Infusion locations measured as anterior-posterior, medial-lateral and dorso-ventral coordinates from bregma were: dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dlPAG) (-4.75, -0.45, -1.9), dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMd) (-2.46, -0.5, -5.35) and anteromedial ventral thalamus (amv) (-0.85, -0.5, -3.9). For optogenetic experiments, fiber optic cannula (0.22 NA, 200 μm diameter; Newdoon) were implanted bilaterally 0.15 mm above the viral infusion sites. Only mice with viral expression restricted to the intended targets were used for behavioral assays.</p>

Adhesive cement (C&amp;B metabond; Parkell, Edgewood, NY, USA) and dental cement (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA) were used to securely attach the fiber optic cannula to the skull. For miniaturized microscope experiments 40 nL of AAV9-DIO-GCaMP6s was injected in the PMd of cck-cre mice and a 7mm GRIN lens was implanted 200 uM above the infusion site.

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Rat Exposure Assay. </b>Mice were accustomed to handling prior to any behavioral assay. On day 1, mice were habituated to a white rectangular box (70 cm length, 26 cm width, 44 cm height) for 20 minutes. Twenty-four hours later, mice were exposed to the same environment but in the presence of a toy rat for 20 minutes. Mice were then exposed to an adult rat or a toy rat in this environment on the two following days. The rat was secured by a harness tied to one of the walls and could freely ambulate only within a short radius of approximately 20 cm. The mouse was placed near the wall opposite to the rat and freely explored the context for 20 minutes. No separating barrier was placed between the mouse and the rat, allowing for close naturalistic encounters that can induce a variety of robust defensive behaviors.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Contextual Fear Conditioning Test. </b>To better evaluate a broader species-specific defense repertoire in face of a conditioned stimulus, we used a modified version of the standard contextual fear conditioning method <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/PEmIx""><span>(Schuette et al., 2020)</span></a>. Pre-shock, fear conditioning and retrieval sessions were performed in a context (70 cm x 17 cm x 40 cm) with an evenly distributed light intensity of 40 lux and a Coulbourn shock grid (19.5 cm x 17 cm) set at the extreme end of the enclosure. Forty-eight hours after rat exposure, mice were habituated to this context and could freely explore the whole environment for 20 minutes. On the following day, the grid was activated, such that a single 0.7 mA foot shock was delivered for 2 seconds only on the first time the mouse fully entered the grid zone. Twenty-four hours later, retrieval sessions were performed in the same enclosure but without shock. Mice could freely explore the context for 20 minutes during pre-shock habituation, fear conditioning and retrieval sessions.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">'Escapes' were defined as epochs for which (1) the mouse speed away from the rat or toy rat exceeded 2 cm/s. As there was little room for acceleration between the rat and opposite wall, the speed threshold was set to this relatively low value.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">'Stretch-attend postures' were defined as epochs for which (1) the distance between mouse nose and tailbase exceeded a distance of approximately 1.2 mouse body lengths and (2) mouse tailbase speed fell below 1 cm/s.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">'Freezes' were defined as periods for which mouse nose and tailbase speed fell below 0.25 cm/s for at least 0.33s <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/PEmIx""><span>(Schuette et al., 2020)</span></a>.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">All behaviors were manually checked by the experimenters for error.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Fiber photometry. </b>Photometry was performed as described in detail previously <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/YkWEz""><span>(Kim et al., 2016)</span></a>. Briefly, we used a 405-nm LED and a 470-nm LED (Thorlabs, M405F1 and M470F1) for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>independent isosbestic control measurements. The two LEDs were bandpass filtered (Thorlabs, FB410-10 and FB470-10) and then combined with a 425-nm longpass dichroic mirror (Thorlabs, DMLP425R) and coupled into the microscope using a 495-nm longpass dichroic mirror (Semrock, FF495-Di02-25 ×36). Mice were connected with a branched patch cord (400 μm, Doric Lenses, Quebec, Canada) using a zirconia sleeve to the optical system. The signal was captured at 20 Hz (alternating 405-nm LED and 470-nm LED). To correct for signal artifacts of a non biological origin (i.e. photobleaching and movement artifacts), custom Matlab scripts leveraged the reference signal (405-nm), unaffected by calcium saturation, to isolate and remove these effects from the calcium signal (470-nm).</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Fiber Photometry behavior-triggered averaging.</b> To plot the behavior-triggered averages, only mice that displayed a minimum of three behavioral instances were included in the corresponding behavioral figure.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Miniscope postprocessing.</b> The open-source UCLA miniscope analysis package (<a href=""https://github.com/daharoni/Miniscope_Analysis""><span>https://github.com/daharoni/Miniscope_Analysis</span></a>) <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/cHnhz""><span>(Aharoni and Hoogland, 2019)</span></a> was used to motion correct miniscope videos. They were then temporally downsampled by a factor of four and spatially downsampled by a factor of two. The cell activity and footprints were extracted using the open-source package Constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for microEndoscopic data (CNMF-E; <a href=""https://github.com/zhoupc/CNMF_E""><span>https://github.com/zhoupc/CNMF_E</span></a>) <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/hwz1e+PEmIx""><span>(Schuette et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2018)</span></a>.

<p style=""margin-bottom:13px;text-align:justify;""><b><span lang=""EN"" style=""background:white;"">Behavior decoding using PMd neural data.</span></b><span lang=""EN"" style=""background:white;""> Discrete classification of escape behavior was performed using multinomial logistic regression. Timepoints following escape by 2 seconds were labelled 'escape,' and a matched number of non-escape timepoints were randomly selected for training and validation. Each time point was treated as an individual data point. Training and validation were performed using 5-fold cross-validation, with a minimum of 10 seconds between training and validation sets. As equal numbers of escape and non-escape samples were used to build the training and validation sets, chance accuracy was 50%. Sessions with less than 5 escapes were excluded from the analysis. The same analysis was performed for approach, stretch-attend postures, and freeze. To predict escape at negative time lags from behavior onset, the same analysis procedure was implemented, using 2-second epochs preceding escape by 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 seconds.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Behavior cell classification.</b> We used a generalized linear model (GLM) to identify cells that showed increased calcium activity during approach, stretch-attend, escape and freeze behaviors. We fit this model to each cell's activity, with behavior indices as the predictor variable and behavior coefficients as the measure of fit. Behavior onset times were then randomized 100 times and a bootstrap distribution built from the resulting GLM coefficients. A cell was considered a behavior-categorized cell if its coefficient exceeded 95% of the bootstrap coefficient values.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Position and speed decoding. </b>To predict position and speed from neural data, these data had their dimensionality reduced by principal component analysis, such that the top principal components, representing at least 80% of the total variance, were used in the following decoding analysis. This output and the related position/speed data were then separated into alternating 60s training and testing blocks, with 10s of separation between blocks. Even blocks were used to train a generalized linear regression model (GLM; Matlab function 'glmfit') and withheld odd blocks were used to test the resulting model.  Accuracies of this withheld testing block were reported as mean squared error.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Chemogenetics. </b>Mice used for chemogenetic experiments were exposed to each threat and control stimuli twice, once following treatment with saline and once following treatment with CNO (5 mg/kg, injected intraperitoneally) 40 minutes prior to the experiment. Only one control or threat-exposure assay was performed per day with each mouse.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Behavior video capture. </b>All behavior videos were captured at 30 frames/sec in standard definition (640x480) using a Logitech HD C310 webcam. To capture fiber-photometry synchronized videos, both the calcium signal and behavior were recorded by the same computer using custom Matlab scripts that also collected timestamp values for each calcium sample/behavioral frame. These timestamps were used to precisely align neural activity and behavior.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Light Delivery for optogenetics.</b> For PMd-cck ChR2 mice, blue light was generated by a 473 nm laser (Dragon Lasers, Changchun Jilin, China) at 4.5 mW unless otherwise indicated. Green light was generated by a 532 nm laser (Dragon Lasers), and bilaterally delivered to mice at 10 mW. A Master-8 pulse generator (A.M.P.I., Jerusalem, Israel) was used to drive the blue laser at 20 Hz. This stimulation pattern was used for all ChR2 experiments. The laser output was delivered to the animal via an optical fiber (200 μm core, 0.22 numerical aperture, Doric Lenses, Canada) coupled to the fiberoptic implanted on the animals through a zirconia sleeve.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Immunostaining for cfos</b>. Fixed brains were kept in 30% sucrose at 4<sup>o</sup>C overnight, and then sectioned on a cryostat (40 µm) slices. Sections were washed in PBS and incubated in a blocking solution (3% normal donkey serum and 0.3% triton-x in PBS) for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were then incubated at 4oC for 12 hours with polyclonal anti-fos antibody made in rabbit (1/500 dilution) (c-Fos (9F6) Rabbit mAb CAT#2250, Cell Signalling Technology) in blocking solution. Following primary antibody incubation sections were washed in PBS 3 times for 10 minutes, and then incubated with anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody (1/500 dilution) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (red) (CAT# 8889S, cellsignal.com) for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were washed in PBS 3 times for 10 minutes, incubated with DAPI (1/50000 dilution in PBS), washed again in PBS and mounted in glass slides using PVA-DABCO (Sigma).</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Perfusion and histological verification.</b> Mice were anesthetized with Fatal-Plus and transcardially perfused with phosphate buffered saline followed by a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde. Extracted brains were stored for 12 hs at 4°C in 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were then placed in sucrose for a minimum of 24 hs. Brains were sectioned in the coronal plane in a cryostat, washed in phosphate buffered saline and mounted on glass slides using PVA-DABCO. Images were acquired using a Keyence BZ-X fluorescence microscope with a 10 or 20X air objective.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Acute brain slice preparation and electrophysiological recordings. </b>Cck-cre driver line mice were injected with AAV9-FLEX-ChR2-YFP in the PMd. Acute slices were prepared from these mie. For electrophysiological measurements, slices were transferred as needed to the recording chamber, where they were perfused with oxygenated aCSF at 32°C. The slices were held in place using a nylon net stretched within a U-shaped platinum wire. Visually-guided whole cell patch clamp recordings were made using infrared differential interference contrast optics. We also verified the identity of PMD neurons by only recording from YFP-positive neurons. All recordings were obtained using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier system (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). Experiments were controlled by PClamp 10 software running on a PC, and the data were acquired using the Digidata 1440A acquisition system. All recording electrodes (3-8 MΩ) were pulled from thin-walled capillary glass (A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA) using a Sutter Instruments P97 puller. The patch pipettes were filled with internal solution containing (in mM) 100 K- gluconate, 20 KCl, 4 ATP-Mg, 10 phospho-creatine, 0.3 GTP-Na, and 10 HEPES (in mM) with a pH of 7.3 and osmolarity of 300 mOsm. Only cells with a stable, uncorrected resting membrane potential (RMP) between -50 to -80 mV, overshooting action potentials, and an input resistance (RN) &gt; 100 MW were used. To minimize the influence of voltage-dependent changes on membrane conductances, all cells were studied at a membrane potential near -60 mV (using constant current injection under current clamp mode). To study intrinsic firing properties of PMD neurons, WCRs were conducted under current clamp using the following protocol: (1) Voltage–current (V-I) relations were obtained using 400 ms current steps (range -50 pA to rheobase) and by plotting the plateau voltage deflection against current amplitude. Neuronal input resistance (RN) was determined from the slope of the linear fit of that portion of the V-I plot where the voltage sweeps did not exhibit sags or active conductance. (2) Intrinsic excitability measurements were obtained using 1s current steps (range 0 to 500 pA) and by plotting the number of action potentials fired against current amplitude. (3) Resting membrane potential (RMP) was calculated as the difference between mean membrane potential during the first minute immediately after obtaining whole cell configuration and after withdrawing the electrode from the neuron.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">For validating hM4Di in PMd-cck cells, acute brain slices preparation and electrophysiological recordings were performed using standard methods as previously described <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/7UpM4""><span>(Nagai et al., 2019)</span></a>. Briefly, Cck-Cre+ mice that had received AAV microinjections into PMd were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated with sharp shears. The brains were placed and sliced in ice-cold modified artificial CSF (aCSF) containing the following (in mM): 194 sucrose, 30 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.2 NaH2PO<sub>4</sub>, and 10 D-glucose, saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. A vibratome (DSK-Zero1) was used to cut 300 μm brain sections. The slices were allowed to equilibrate for 30 minutes at 32-34°C in normal aCSF containing (in mM); 124 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and 10 D-glucose continuously bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Slices were then stored at 21–23°C in the same buffer until use. All slices were used within 2-6 hours of slicing.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Slices were placed in the recording chamber and continuously perfused with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> bubbled normal aCSF. pCLAMP10.4 software and a Multi-Clamp 700B amplifier was used for electrophysiology (Molecular Devices). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from neurons in the PMd or dorsolateral PAG (dlPAG) using patch pipettes with a typical resistance of 4–5 MΩ. Neurons were selected based on reporter fluorescence,(mCherry for hM4Di-mCherry). The intracellular solution for recordings comprised the following (in mM) : 135 potassium gluconate, 5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP and 0.3 Na-GTP, pH 7.3 adjusted with KOH. The initial access resistance values were &lt; 20 MΩ for all cells; if this changed by &gt; 20% the cell was discarded. Light flashes (0.2 mW/mm2) from a blue LED light source (Sutter Instruments) were delivered via the microscope optics and a 40x water immersion objective lens and controlled remotely using TTL pulses from Clampex. Cell responses were recorded in whole-cell mode and recorded using an Axopatch 700B amplifier connected via a digitizer to a computer with pCLAMP10 software. To stimulate ChR2 expressed in PMd neurons or axons, 5 ms pulses were delivered at inter-pulse intervals of 200 ms, 50 ms or 25 ms for 5, 20 or 40 Hz optical stimulations, respectively.</p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;""><b>Participants. </b>This study included 48 adult participants (mean ± SD age: 25.1 ± 7.1; 27 male, 21 female; 7 left-handed; 40 white and 8 non-white (1 Hispanic, 5 Asian, 1 Black and 1 American Indian)). All participants were healthy, with normal or corrected to normal vision and normal hearing, and with no history of psychiatric, physiological or pain disorders and neurological conditions, no current pain symptoms and no MRI contraindications. Eligibility was assessed with a general health questionnaire, a pain safety screening form and an MRI safety screening form. Participants were recruited from the Boulder/Denver Metro Area. The institutional review board of the University of Colorado Boulder approved the study, and all participants provided written informed consent.</p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;""><b>Experimental Paradigm. </b>Participants received five different types of aversive stimulation (mechanical pain, thermal pain, aversive auditory, aversive visual, and pleasant visual), each at four stimulus intensities. 24 stimuli of each type (6 per intensity) were presented over six fMRI runs in random order. Following stimulation on each trial, participants made behavioral ratings of their subjective experience. Participants were instructed to answer the question 'How much do you want to avoid this experience in the future?'. Ratings were made with a non-linear visual analog rating scale, with anchors 'Not at all' and 'Most' displayed at the ends of the scale.</p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;""><b>Stimuli.</b> Visual stimulation<i> </i>was administered on the MRI screen and included normed images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) database <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/tVsid""><span>(Lang et al., 2008)</span></a>. To induce four 'stimulus intensity levels' we selected four groups of 7 images based on their   normed aversiveness ratings (averaged across male and female raters) available in the IAPS database and confirmed by <i>N</i> = 10 lab members (5 male, 5 female) in response to 'How aversive is this image? 1-100'. Selected images included photographs of animals (n=7), bodily illness and injury (n=12), industrial and human waste (n=9). Four stimulus levels were delivered to participants for 10 sec each.</p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;""><b>MRI data acquisition and preprocessing.</b></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;"">Whole-brain fMRI data were acquired on a 3T Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma Fit MRI scanner at the Intermountain Neuroimaging Consortium facility at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Structural images were acquired using high-resolution T1 spoiled gradient recall images (SPGR) for anatomical localization and warping to standard MNI space. Functional images were acquired with a multiband EPI sequence (TR = 460 ms, TE = 27.2 ms, field of view = 220 mm, multiband acceleration factor = 8, flip angle = 44°, 64 × 64 image matrix, 2.7 mm isotropic voxels, 56 interleaved slices, phase encoding posterior &gt;&gt; anterior). Six runs of 7.17 mins duration (934 total measurements) were acquired. Stimulus presentation and behavioral data acquisition were controlled using Psychtoolbox.</p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;"">FMRI data were preprocessed using an automated pipeline implemented by the Mind Research Network, Albuquerque, NM. Briefly, the preprocessing steps included: distortion correction using FSL's top-up tool (<a href=""https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/topup""><span>https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/</span></a>), motion correction (affine alignment of first EPI volume (reference image) to T1, followed by affine alignment of all EPI volumes to the reference image and estimation of the motion parameter file (sepi_vr_motion.1D, AFNI,<a href=""https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/""> </a><a href=""https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/""><span>https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/</span></a>), spatial normalization via subject's T1 image (T1 normalization to MNI space (nonlinear transform), normalization of EPI image to MNI space (3dNWarpApply, AFNI, <a href=""https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/""> </a><a href=""https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/""><span>https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/</span></a>), interpolation to 2 mm isotropic voxels and smoothing with a 6 mm FWHM kernel (SPM 8,<a href=""https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/""> </a><a href=""https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/"">https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/</a>).</p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;"">Prior to first level (within-subject) analysis, we removed the first four volumes to allow for image intensity stabilization. We also identified image-wise outliers by computing both the mean and the standard deviation (across voxels) of intensity values for each image for all slices to remove intermittent gradient and severe motion-related artifacts (spikes) that are present to some degree in all fMRI data.</p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;""><b>fMRI data analysis.</b> Data were analyzed using SPM12 (<a href=""http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm""><span>http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm</span></a>) and custom MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) code available from the authors' website (<a href=""http://github.com/canlab/CanlabCore"">http://github.com/canlab/CanlabCore</a>). First-level general linear model (GLM) analyses were conducted in SPM12. The six runs were concatenated for each subject. Boxcar regressors, convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function, were constructed to model periods for the 10-second stimulation and 4-7 second rating periods. The fixation cross epoch was used as an implicit baseline. A high-pass filter of 0.008 Hz was applied. Nuisance variables included (a) ""dummy"" regressors coding for each run (intercept for each run); (b) linear drift across time within each run; (c) the six estimated head movement parameters (x, y, z, roll, pitch, and yaw), their mean-centered squares, their derivatives, and squared derivative for each run (total 24 columns); and (d) motion outliers (spikes) identified in the previous step. A ""single-trial model"" was used to uniquely estimate the response to every stimulus in order to assess functional connectivity.</p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;""><b>Functional connectivity analysis. </b>Functional connectivity between the hypothalamus and PAG was estimated using Partial Least Squares (PLS) <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/YiPzJ""><span>(Wold et al., 2001)</span></a> regression, which identifies latent multivariate patterns that maximize the covariance between two blocks of data (i.e., BOLD activity in hypothalamus and PAG voxels). Here, data comprised single trial estimates of brain activation in response to aversive thermal, mechanical, auditory, and visual stimuli, in addition to a set of pleasant visual stimuli which were used as a control. For the PLS model, the predictor block of variables included all voxels in an anatomically defined mask of the hypothalamus <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/6iTFD""><span>(Pauli et al., 2018)</span></a> (337 voxels) and the outcome block included all voxels in the PAG <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/Ov9VY""><span>(Kragel et al., 2019)</span></a> (42 voxels). Localization of the hypothalamus signal that covaries with the PAG responses was performed by bootstrapping the PLS regression and examining the distribution of PLS regression coefficients and their deviation from zero (using normal approximation for inference). Hyperalignment of fMRI data <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/SXIFJ""><span>(Haxby et al., 2011)</span></a> was conducted separately for each region as a preprocessing step, and leave-one-subject-out cross-validation was performed to estimate the strength of functional connections (i.e., the Pearson correlation between the first 'X score' and 'Y score' estimated by PLS, similar to the canonical correlation <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/tGiPX""><span>(Hardoon et al., 2004)</span></a>.</p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;"">A benefit of the pathway-identification model we employed is that it can, in principle, identify HTH and PAG patterns that distinctly participate in the HTH-PAG pathway. For example, the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) projects to both the hypothalamus and the PAG <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/4yIGk""><span>(Kim et al., 2013)</span></a>, and could indirectly explain variation in BOLD signals in the PAG. To test pathway specificity, we separately modeled a pathway between the CeA and the PAG using the approach described above. This allowed us to evaluate how much variation in PAG activity the HTH-PAG pathway explained above and beyond the CeA-PAG pathway. To evaluate this, we computed the partial correlation between latent sources in the hypothalamus and PAG, controlling for the latent source in the CeA.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Statistics. </b>Nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank or rank-sum tests were used, unless otherwise stated. Two-tailed tests were used throughout with α=0.05. Asterisks in the Figures indicate the <i>p</i> values. Standard error of the mean was plotted in each Figure as an estimate of variation. Multiple comparisons were adjusted with the false discovery rate (FDR) method.</p> <p>Escape from threats has paramount importance for survival. However, it is unknown if a single circuit controls escape from innate and conditioned threats. The hypothalamic dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMd) may control escape, as it is strongly activated by escape-inducing threats and projects to the region most implicated in escape, the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dlPAG). We show that in mice cholecystokinin (cck)-expressing PMd cells are activated during escape, but not other defensive behaviors. PMd-cck ensemble activity can also predict future escape. Furthermore, PMd inhibition decreases escape speed from both innate and conditioned threats. Inhibition of the PMd-cck projection to the dlPAG also decreased escape speed. Lastly, human fMRI data show that a posterior hypothalamic-to-dlPAG pathway increases activity during exposure to aversive images, indicating that a similar pathway may possibly have a related role in humans. Our data identify the PMd as a central node of the escape network.</p> <p>Explanation of variables used:</p>

<p>The first version of a U.S.-EPA-BELD4-equivalent landuse database for Canada was compiled in 2018 by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) based on: (1) the first version of Canada-wide tree species composition maps based on the 2001 Canadian National Forest Inventory (NFI; Beaudoin et al., 2014); (2) the 2016 Canadian Annual Crop Inventory (ACI); and (3) the Land Cover Classification System surface hydrology (LCCS3) data set contained in the Collection 6 MODIS Land Cover product MCD12Q1 (Zhang and Moran, 2018).&nbsp; Recently, an improved mapping approach for estimating forest attributes from MODIS imagery was applied to reprocess the 2001 NFI-based species composition maps and to create a new set of species composition maps for 2011 using 2011 MODIS imagery (Beaudoin et al., 2017a,b).&nbsp; The new mapping approach resulted in an improved set of 2001 species composition maps as indicated by increased correlation coefficients and decreased mean deviations (MD) and root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) between 35,305 MODIS reference pixels for 2001 and the 2001 NFI photo-plot product (Beaudoin et al., 2017b). &nbsp;In addition, for the new 2011 species composition maps, expected reductions in forest coverage were seen for areas of Canada that had experienced rapid development between 2001 and 2011, such as the Athabasca Oil Sands (AOS) area in northeastern Alberta and areas near major urban centres such as Toronto and Vancouver.&nbsp; Given the improved mapping approach and the greater recentness of the 2011 tree species composition maps, the Canadian BELD4 landuse database was updated using these new 2011 maps and the same methodology described in Zhang and Moran (2018).&nbsp; Note that no change was made to the ACI and MODIS Land Cover product data sets that were used to develop this new database version.</p>

<p>Because the number of tree species considered in the 2001 NFI-based forest composition maps was reduced from 109 in the first version to 75 in the second version due to the least abundant tree species being lumped with other related species (Beaudoin et al., 2017b), gridded fractional-coverage fields for the U.S.-EPA-BELD4-equivalent landuse categories compiled for Canada have also been reduced, from 92 in the first version of the Canadian BELD4 database to 80 in this second version.&nbsp; The mapping from the 75 NFI tree species to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) BELD4 landuse categories is shown in the attached spreadsheet &ldquo;ACI_NFI_BELD4_species_match_V2.xlsx&rdquo;, along with the unchanged mapping of 62 ACI species and other landuse categories.&nbsp; The mapping used to link the LCCS3 categories to the BELD4 categories also remains unchanged and is described in the attached Excel file &ldquo;MODIS_LCCS3_BELD4_mapping.xlsx&rdquo;. &nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Mitigating climate change is an urgent challenge for society. Increasing carbon storage in forests, which cover more than 30% of the global land surface, presents a key opportunity to meet this challenge. Although the biophysical and ecological factors that affect carbon storage have been well studied, the relative importance of social factors in privately owned forests, such as people&rsquo;s goals and management actions, is less well understood.</p>

<p>2. We examine how well typical biophysical and ecological variables can explain differences in aboveground carbon storage across 1561 plots in temperate forests of southern Quebec, Canada. We then identify bright spots and dark spots of aboveground carbon storage, where forests are performing much better or worse than predicted based on biophysical and ecological conditions alone. We conducted surveys with forest owners to assess whether their individual goals, values, and management actions explain the differences in carbon storage between bright and dark spots.</p>

<p>3. Biophysical and ecological variables collectively explained a substantial fraction of the variation in carbon storage between forest plots (R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.42). The ecological variables of stand age, species richness, and functional diversity within the plots were the most important variables in explaining carbon storage.</p>

<p>4. Surveys with forest owners showed that bright spots (plots that stored more carbon than predicted) were often associated with a strong connection to, or dependence on, the forest property. Dark spots were more often associated with forest harvesting and hunting.</p>

<p>5. <em>Synthesis and applications</em>: Ecologically-based policies that aim to increase the average forest age, species richness, and functional diversity&mdash;and socially-based policies that incentivise long-term forest ownership, stronger connections between people and their properties, and maple syrup production&mdash;could help increase carbon storage over multidecadal timescales and thereby reduce the harmful effects of climate change.</p>","2021-07-27","0,3",NA,"yes","cant access",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA","NA","Journal of Applied Ecology","https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5140459","no","zenodo"

The vast geographical distribution and behavioural variability of caribou warranted the development and validation of an appropriate conservation tool for managers in eastern Canada. We developed a habitat suitability model for boreal caribou in Québec by integrating expert knowledge into a hierarchical analysis. We elicited responses from 14 experts on caribou ecology to determine the best spatiotemporal scales of application, the relative importance of habitat variables, the zone of influence of human infrastructure, and the parameterization of the model. Based on this input, we built the model using 8 habitat categories and 3 human infrastructure variables. Experts identified mature conifer-dominated forests and open lichen woodlands as the most important vegetation categories for boreal caribou, whereas density of and proximity to paved roads, forest roads, and mines decreased habitat quality. We mapped the resulting model over the entire province of Québec (up to the northern forest allocation limit), and validated it using independent GPS telemetry datasets acquired in 3 distinct regions. Our model predicted that habitat suitability was highest in the northeastern part of our study area, where timber harvest activities and roads were virtually absent. Conversely, southern parts of Québec were generally unsuitable for boreal caribou. Our habitat suitability model is among the first tools for boreal caribou conservation available to wildlife and land managers in Québec. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Answers to the questionnaire by 14 experts on boreal caribou across Canada<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">We elicited responses from 14 experts on caribou ecology to determine the best spatiotemporal scales of application, the relative importance of habitat variables, the zone of influence of human infrastructure, and the parameterization of the model.

Stocking methods are used in the Province of Quebec to restore Salmo salar populations. However, Atlantic salmon stocked juveniles show higher mortality rates than wild ones when introduced into nature. Hatchery environment, which greatly differs from the natural environment, is  identified as the main driver of the phenotypic mismatch between captive and wild parrs. The latter is also suspected to impact the gut microbiota composition, which can be associated with essential metabolic functions for their host. We hypothesized that hatchery raised parrs potentially recruit gut microbial communities that are different from those  recruited in the wild. This study evaluated the impacts of artificial rearing on gut microbiota composition in 0+ parrs meant for stocking in two distinct Canadian rivers: Rimouski and Malbaie (Quebec, Canada). Striking differences between hatchery and wild born parrs\' gut microbiota suggest that microbiota could be another factor that could impact their survival in the targeted river, since the microbiome is narrowly related to host physiology. For instance, major commensals belonging to Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridiacea from wild parrs\' gut microbiota were substituted in captive parrs by lactic acid bacteria from the Lactobacillaceae family. Overall, captive parrs host a generalist bacterial community whereas wild parrs\' microbiota is much more specialized. This is the very first study demonstrating extensive impact of captive rearing on intestinal microbiota composition in Atlantic salmon intended for wild population stocking. Our results strongly suggest the need to implement microbial ecology concepts into conservation management of endangered salmon stocks supplemented with hatchery reared parrs. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">16S_reads_salmo_salar_V3_V4_gut_microbiota.tar<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">16S paired end reads from Salmo salar gut microbiota and water samples.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div> Captive Populations; 16S SSU rRNA gene; Endangered species management; Salmo salar; 2013; metabarcoding sequencing; Aquaculture; Stocking Quebec","NA","3",NA,"yes","X","repository",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gut microbiota from atlantic salmon",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"genetic analysis","NA","NA","Evolutionary Applications","https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.12658","no","dryad"

Raccoon rabies variant (RRV) is a zoonosis of concern for humans because its main vector, the raccoon (Procyon lotor), is found near residential areas. In Québec, Canada, all cases of RRV found in raccoons since 2006 were detected on the eastern side of the Richelieu River, suggesting that this river acts as a barrier to gene flow and thus, the potential for RRV to spread. The objectives of this study were to characterize the genetic structure of raccoon populations and assess the effect of the Richelieu River on the population structure in southern Québec, Canada. We also evaluated whether RRV spread potential differed between sex and at a larger spatial scale. Our analyses revealed a weak signal of genetic differentiation among individuals located on each side of the Richelieu River. At a larger spatial scale, genetic structuring was weak. Our results suggest that rivers might not always efficiently restrain raccoon movements and spread of RRV. We suggest that the difference in genetic structure found between sexes can be partly explained by male movements during the breeding season in winter, when ice bridges allow passage over most rivers in Québec. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">data within RRV area<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Genetic data for animal located within the RRV surveillance area.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">data sites outside RRV area<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data for sites on the North shore of the St-Lawrence River and on Islands.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div> Procyon lotor; Disease Biology; Wildlife Management Canada; Québec","NA","0",NA,"yes","M","repository",".xlsx","sample coordinates","geological feature me","Map, geological feature me","Procyon lotor","2008-2009","2008","2009","source publication text","1","not given","21000","source publication text","presence only, EBV genetic analysis","NA","NA","Evolutionary Applications","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-4571.2012.00238.x","no","zenodo"
