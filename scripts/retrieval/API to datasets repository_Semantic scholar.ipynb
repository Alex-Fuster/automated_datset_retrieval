Studies around the world have evaluated the succession of arthropods on animal carcasses, but no published data are available for the province of Quebec (Canada). The objective of this study was to evaluate the diversity of arthropods associated with pig carcasses in Quebec, and to determine the colonization sequence of the different families/species throughout the decomposition process. Three pig carcasses were deposited in a small woodland area in Trois-Rivières, in mid-June 2019. The decomposition process and the arthropod community were studied until the beginning of November (first snowfall) by visual observation, and sample collection on the carcasses, using an entomological net and pitfall traps. Five species of blow fly (Diptera: Calliphoridae) were found to lay eggs on the carcasses: Calliphora livida, C. vomitoria, Lucilia illustris, Phormia regina, and Protophormia terraenovae. Eggs/larvae of the first three species were recorded during the first week only (fresh stage-beginning of active decay), while the other two species were recorded throughout the decomposition process until the dry remains stage. Coleoptera were observed from day 0 to day 141 (end of experiment). Some families/species were associated with early stages of decomposition (e.g. Necrophila americana, Silphidae), while others were only found during the dry remains stage (e.g. Carnicops pumilio, Histeridae).', 'venue': '', 'year': 2020}\n",

The approximately 6,000 extant species on Earth can be variously found on all continents, except Antarctica. A relatively stable taxonomy, a relative ease of species identification and an aquatic immature stage has made the Odonata a taxon of interest in documenting the symptoms of global environmental change, especially at higher latitudes. The Odonata fauna of the north-temperate Canadian province of Quebec includes 150 species, many of which are at the northern limits of their geographic distribution. New information Quebec hosts multiple entomological specimen depositories, including seven publicly-accessible research collections. One of these, the University of Montreal's Ouellet-Robert Entomological Collection, houses an exceptionally large collection of Odonata. An initial specimen data capture project for this collection gathered 31,595 Quebec Odonata occurrence records, but several Quebec species were missing and geographic coverage was biased towards the Montreal region. To complement this dataset, we undertook to digitise the Odonata records of six other public research collections. They are, in order of Quebec Odonata collection size, the Laval University Entomological Collection, McGill University's Lyman Entomological Museum, the Insectarium of Montreal Research Collection, the Quebec Government's Insect Collection, Bishop's University's Insect Collection and the Laurentian Forestry Centre's René-Martineau Insectarium. Of the 40,447 total specimen occurrence records, 36,951 are identified to the species level, including 137 of the 150 species officially-recorded in Quebec and 2 non-nominotypical subspecies. We here summarise the data and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the datasets. The complete dataset is available with this publication (Suppl. material 1), whereas the specimen data associated with each collection are available as Darwin Core archives at Canadensys.net and will be updated as appropriate.\", 'venue': 'Biodiversity Data Journal', 'year': 2020}\n",

This research characterizes the regional distribution and abundance of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) near its northern range limit in northwestern Quebec, Canada, using a combination of remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS) analysis, and ground-based techniques. Although not regionally abundant, aspen is the main deciduous tree species in this conifer dominated landscape. Regionally, the ~51,200 km2 study area has few settlements or roads, and is without industrial activity that affects the land. Most of the region is inaccessible except by foot or water travel. We utilized Landsat Thematic Mapper images from 2010 and 2011, a robust collection of ground reference data developed from aerial photography, supported by field verification (vegetation sampling) where access permitted, to construct a thematic map of 11 land cover classes. The map highlights the spatial distribution of aspen, which represents only 0.3% of the study area. Map validation indicated an overall mapping accuracy of 74%, while the aspen predicted class was assessed at over 77% accurate. The regional scale distribution of aspen stands â‰¥ 0.5 ha within the study area shows two patterns: (1) a shift toward greatest abundance on south-facing aspects with increasing latitude; and (2) a highly clustered pattern that includes concentrations in areas of human disturbance. These patterns suggest that aspen range expansion due to climate-change related warming will vary with topographic and other microclimatic factors, i.e. be a function of climate change interacting with landscapes, and that anthropogenic disturbances have the potential to influence future aspen abundance independently of climate. Forest management policies concerned with changing forest composition in these northern landscapes should recognize the potentially important role of human activity in driving the abundance of aspen. \\n \\nKeywords: Boreal forest ecology, climate change, land cover classification, aspen, species distribution.', 'venue': '', 'year': 2014}\n",

Six hundred forty two strains representing 159 genera and 441 species from clinical specimens previously identified at the Laboratoire de santé publique du Québec (LSPQ) by reference methods were retrospectively chosen for the study. They included 254 Gram-positive bacteria, 167 Gram-negative bacteria, 109 mycobacteria and aerobic actinomycetes and 112 yeasts and moulds. MALDI-TOF MS analyses were performed on both systems according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Of the 642 strains tested, the name of the genus and / or species of 572 strains were referenced in the Bruker database while 406 were present in the VITEK MS IVD database. The Biotyper correctly identified 494 (86.4%) of the strains, while the VITEK MS correctly identified 362 (92.3%) of the strains (excluding 14 mycobacteria that were not tested). Of the 70 strains not present in the Bruker database at the species level, the Biotyper correctly identified 10 (14.3%) to the genus level and 2 (2.9%) to the complex/group level. For 52 (74.2%) strains, we obtained no identification, and an incorrect identification was given for 6 (8.6%) strains. Of the 178 strains not present in the VITEK MS IVD database at the species level (excluding 71 untested mycobacteria and actinomycetes), the VITEK MS correctly identified 12 (6.8%) of the strains each to the genus and to the complex/group level. For 97 (54.5%) strains, no identification was given and for 69 (38.7%) strains, an incorrect identification was obtained. Our study demonstrates that both systems gave a high level (above 85%) of correct identification for a wide range of microorganisms. However, VITEK MS gave more misidentification when the microorganism analysed was not present in the database, compared to Bruker Biotyper. This should be taken into account when this technology is used alone for microorganism identification in a public health laboratory, where isolates received are often difficult to identify and/or unusual microorganisms.', 'venue': 'PLoS ONE', 'year': 2015}\n",

From the collection of 22,409 identifiable specimens, 28 species and four associations representing 12 genera and one group of drepanodontiform elements are documented and their stratigraphic ranges established. One new genus, Rexroadus, is established for two species earlier assigned with question to Oulodus. New species described are Icriodella dicrana, Oulodus sigmoideus, Ozarkodina strena, and Pterospathodus? originalis. The fauna is dominated by species of Ozarkodina and Oulodus; many species have a first appearance that is slightly older than elsewhere suggesting that the Anticosti Basin may have been an important evolutionary radiative center in the early Silurian. There is a slow and progressive diversity increase in conodonts through this interval after the initial appearance of many new taxa in the basal Silurian following the mass extinction in the terminal Ordovician. The Anticosti Llandovery sequence represents one of the few highly fossiliferous, continuous successions in the world and a new conodont biozonation based on conodonts for the Llandovery is proposed with the following interval zones in ascending order: Ozarkodina hassi (new), Ozarkodina strena (new) [subdivided into Oulodus jeannae (new) and Oulodus panuarensis (new) subzones], Ozarkodina clavula (new), Ozarkodina aldridgei (new), Pterospathodus celloni, and Pterospathodus amorphognathoides zones.', 'venue': 'Journal of Paleontology', 'year': 2002}\n",

Subsequent inspection of elm trees by naturalists and scientists in the south of the province led to the conclusion that the species is more widely distributed than first expected and that the invasion is not localised to a small area. Preliminary genetic data pointed to a possible European origin of the Canadian population, but conclusive assignment to source will require examination of more specimens and the collection of reference sequences from different European and Asian populations.

One basic premise of dendroclimatology is that tree rings can be viewed as climate proxies, i.e. rings are assumed to contain some hidden information about past climate. From a statistical perspective, this extraction problem can be understood as the search of a hidden variable which represents the common signal within a collection of tree-ring width series. Classical average-based techniques used in dendrochronology have been applied to estimate the mean behavior of this latent variable. Still, depending on tree species, regional factors and statistical methods, a precise quantification of uncertainties associated to the hidden variable distribution is difficult to assess. To model the error propagation throughout the extraction procedure, we propose and study a Bayesian hierarchical model that focuses on extracting an inter-annual high frequency signal. Our method is applied to black spruce (Picea mariana) tree-rings recorded in Northern Quebec and compared to a classical average-based techniques used by dendrochronologists (Cook and Kairiukstis, 1992).', 'venue': '', 'year': 2009}\n",

However, a single female specimen identified by Hurd in 1954 as X. varipuncta Patton, 1879 from British Columbia is in the C.A. Triplehorn Insect Collection at The Ohio State University (OSUC), suggesting that this species was accidentally introduced into coastal western Canada. As wood-nesters, many large carpenter bees are likely capable of expanding their range great distances by natural and unnatural transport methods while nesting inside suitable substrates, the presumed mode of transport into western Canada, and likely elsewhere. The ease at which the nests are transported has likely contributed to the nomenclatural and distributional ambiguity surrounding this species due to morphological similarities of specimens from North America, Hawaii, and several South Pacific islands. New information By comparing DNA barcodes of specimens from the western United States to specimens from Hawaii, we confirm the early opinion of P.H. Timberlake (Timberlake 1922) that specimens long established on the Hawaiian Islands are the same X. varipuncta from continental North America. Furthermore, these DNA barcode sequences also match those of specimens identified as X. sonorina Smith, 1874 from the French Polynesian and Samoan Islands, thus fully supporting the opinion of Groom et al. (2017) that all are likely conspecific. As X. sonorina, a species described from and likely introduced to Hawaii is the oldest name available, X. varipuncta is here placed into synonymy. Additional research will be needed to trace the timing and pathway of introduction and establishment of X. sonorina; it is presumed that the species is native to the southwestern United States but has been established in Hawaii since the mid-1800s. It is also established in French Polynesia, the Samoan Islands, and likely other south Pacific islands, with additional records of occurrence from Java, New Zealand, and now Canada.', 'venue': 'Biodiversity Data Journal', 'year': 2020}\n",

Sixty-two samples were collected from the Table Head and Long Point groups, western Newfoundland, the Jolliet Group, Anticosti Island, and the Trenton Group, St. Lawrence Lowlands. These yielded over 2600 moderately to well-preserved ostracodes. The Carter Collection, an existing collection of ostracodes from the Lowlands, was also examined. During the research, a series of difficulties were encountered in obtaining the faunas, interpreting their taxonomy, and understanding their paleoenvironmental implications. -- In the sections studied, Ordovician ostracodes occurred sporadically and were often rare or absent. All the collections were obtained by washing soft shales or by vibra-tool preparation of indurate limestones; selection of samples that can be readily processed is essential. Ordovician ostracode taxonomy is often confusing; many species are narrowly defined and allow little morphological variation. In this study, the taxonomy of a number of species is revised and a number of existing species are re-interpreted as synonyms. Fifty-four species representing forty genera are described and illustrated. No new species are established, because the current species are either already described in the literature, or could only be identified at the generic level because of a lack of well-preserved material. -- Although faunal composition, abundance and diversity arc directly influenced by the paleoenvironment, it is difficult to develop ostracode-based criteria for the elucidation of Ordovician paleoenvironments. Observations made during this study indicate that sea-level changes and water depth were strong controls on the nature of Ordovician ostracode faunas. In the Lourdes Formation, western Newfoundland and the Ellis Bay Formation, Anticosti Island, marked increases in faunal diversity and the rates of speciation can be directly correlated with transgressive events that increased the shelf area and the variety of niches available. Water depth, through its control of a variety of interdependent ecological factors, such as water temperature, food supply and substrate, was also an important influence on the type of ostracode community present. A series of depth-related communities are tentatively recognised. High- energy, nearshore environments tend to have a high-abundance, low-diversity fauna consisting of large, robust, smooth ostracodes; speciation rates are low and the community structure is relatively stable. Stable, open shelf, carbonate environments tend to have high-diversity faunas, consisting of a wide variety of ornamented forms such as Eurychilina subradiata and Foramenella phippsi; speciation rates are high and the community structure frequently changes. Outer shelf to shelf-slope environments tend to have a low-diversity, low-abundance fauna consisting of drepanellids such as Warthinia nodosa and smooth-elongate ostracodes like Phelobythocypris cylindrica; speciation rates are low and the community structure is stable. As depth increases and the shelf-slope transition is crossed, faunal abundance and diversity diminish rapidly and in situ ostracode faunas disappear altogether. -- Effective use of Ordovician ostracodes as biostratigraphic indicators, depends on their ability to cross facies and provincial boundaries. At present it is not possible to make more than crude correlations, because the faunas are not well enough known. A few of the species, such as Eurychilina subradiata and Tetradella quadrilirata, are wide ranging and have obvious potential for correlating Ordovician shelf sediments. Many other species cannot be used for inter- or intra-regional correlation, because they are locally endemic, occurring in some areas, but not in others.', 'venue': '', 'year': 1991}\n",

We explore, in this study, the possibility of using an electronic tool to monitor occurrence of the tick vector of Lyme disease, Ixodes scapularis. The study aimed to compare the capacity for ticks to be identified in web-based submissions of digital images/photographs, to the traditional specimen-based identification method used by the provincial public health laboratory in Quebec, Canada. Forty-one veterinary clinics participated in the study by submitting digital images of ticks collected from pets via a website for image-based identification by an entomologist. The tick specimens were then sent to the provincial public health laboratory to be identified by the ‘gold standard’ method using a microscope. Of the images submitted online, 74·3% (284/382) were considered of high-enough quality to allow identification. The laboratory identified 382 tick specimens from seven different species, with I. scapularis representing 76% of the total submissions. Of the 284 ticks suitable for image-based species identification, 276 (97·2%) were correctly identified (Kappa statistic of 0·92, Z = 15·46, P < 0·001).

Elevation as well as the date of collection did not influence germination of seeds of P. annua, and total germination remained very high (>80%) at high elevations.

Our overall goal was to test if soil perturbation and planting fast-growing species could promote the reestablishment of a relatively diverse plant community. A chronosequence that included three plantations (4, 8, and 12-year old) established after soil scarification, paired with three natural stands representative of the local temperate mixedwood forest comprising both pioneer and late-successional tree species, was implemented. Vegetation surveys and soil collection were performed in 2012 and species traits were provided by the Traits Of Plants In Canada and TRY databases. Principal response curve analyses showed species and functional trait divergence between treated and natural stands at ages 4 and 8, but that those divergences were less at age 12. Species and trait convergences were slower in the scarification furrows than in the scarification berms (mounds between furrows). However, severe site preparation did not appear to affect soil variables on the study sites. Our results suggest that even following severe site preparation, gradual recovery of species and trait composition similar to that of natural stands appears possible in the long term, mainly through fast canopy development by hybrid poplar. However, organic material export and soil erosion risks associated with this type of site preparation need to be evaluated. EDITED BY Sheila Ward', 'venue': '', 'year': 2016}\n",

Here in collaboration with a local oil recycling company (Québec, Canada), we assessed the biodiversity of bacteria and studied their ability to metabolize used engine oil (UEO). The bacterial species identified (Paenibacillus, Klebsiella, Micrococcus, Microbacterium, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus and Stenotrophomonas) were similar to those found elsewhere in the world, including countries with much warmer climate than Canada (like China, India, and Egypt to name a few). This suggests that UEO as main carbon source -and not climateis determinant for the biodiversity on UEO collection sites. Many bacterial strains identified here resisted to exposure to UEO at higher concentration (20% v/v) than reported earlier. As observed in earlier reports for many bacteria under various growth conditions, bacteria screened from this UEO source were also able to produce an intracellular biopolymer that was identified as a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA). We also identified an interesting consortium (composed of Stenotrophomonas and Rhodococcus) that metabolized UEO alkanes, and appeared suitable for two applications: bioremediation and biopolymer production. Under specific conditions, this same bacterial consortium secreted an elastomer-like biopolymer. The biopolymer formed at the surface of broth cultures where it was easily recovered. Based on FTIR analyses, the biopolymer was tentatively identified as ethylene propylene diene monomer (an EPDM rubber). To our knowledge, the conversion of UEO into an extracellular elastomer by bacteria has not been previously reported. Both species were found to be necessary for production of this biopolymer, suggesting a synergy among their respective metabolic machinery.', 'venue': '', 'year': 2018}\n",

Spangler (1961) reviewed the distribution and biology of S. tessellata, recording it from the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and Quebec as well as from localities throughout eastern United States. Smetana (1988), in his important review of the hydrophilidae of Canada, provides only three Canadian collection records for S. tessellata: one from Nova Scotia, one from Quebec and one from New Brunswick. roughley (1991) used Smetana’s review as the basis for a checklist of hydrophilidae of Canada, but gave the known Canadian distribution of S. tessellata as Nova Scotia, Quebec and Ontario instead of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Quebec. There are no Ontario specimens of S. tessellata in the Wallis-roughley Museum of Entomology (University of Manitoba) so roughley’s listing of Sperchopsis from Ontario was probably a lapsus. The relatively large (about 7 mm long), strikingly convex, pitted adults of this species are easily distinguished from other water scavenger beetles, so it is unlikely that it would be overlooked in collections or samples from aquatic insect surveys. The new Ontario records of Sperchopsis given below are based on the only known Ontario collections of the genus. I first collected and identified this species from Ontario in 1976, from the Credit river near Belfountain in Wellington County. Despite subsequent searching in apparently suitable parts of other streams and rivers in southern Ontario (including the Eramosa, Saugeen, Speed, Grand, Sauble, rankin and Crane rivers), no further Sperchopsis specimens were found until 2007 and 2008, when one beetle was found on rotting wood embedded in an undercut sandy bank in the Credit river near Erin, and another was collected in the Credit River very close to where the first Ontario specimen had been collected 31 years earlier.

Although this turfgrass species has desirable playing attributes, it suffers from susceptibility to environmental and biological stresses including subfreezing temperatures and snow molds. In this study, we compared 29 genotypes collected from golf greens located in Quebec and Ontario for their resistance to pink snow mold (SM). Plants were inoculated with Microdochium nivale [(Fries) Samuels & Hallett], causal agent of SM, and incubated under controlled conditions. High levels of variation in SM resistance were detected within the collection and between genotypes. Analysis of the relationship between climatic parameters at the sites of origin and SM susceptibility revealed that level of resistance was positively correlated to the duration of snow cover. Genetic diversity within the Poa collection was estimated using the sequence related amplifi ed polymorphism (SRAP) technique. The UPGMA (unweighted-pair group method arithmetic average) dendrogram yielded two main clusters that differed markedly in their proportion of SM-resistant genotypes. Our results show that SM disease is a major selection pressure for the generation of genetic diversity among annual bluegrass biotypes that evolved on golf greens in northern climates. SRAP polymorphisms between bulked genotypes with contrasting resistance to SM were identifi ed and could be used as markers for SM resistance in annual bluegrass.', 'venue': '', 'year': 2009}\n",

Ex Fr.) Pouzar as a natural means of controlling vegetative regrowth from stumps of native hardwoods is receiving increased attention in Canada (Gosselin 1996, Dumal et al. 1997, Shamoun and Hintz 1998). The technique involves treating freshly cut stumps with the mycelium of indigenous strains of this ubiquitous fungus. However, the deployment of fungal plant pathogens with wide host-ranges may have certain undesirable environmental side effects. These negative impacts may be linked, among others, to the introduction of new genetic material to local genepools and to increased post-treatment spore load. In addressing both of these topics, we assessed: i) the extent of genetic variability among Canadian populations of C. purpureum both within and between different ecozones, and ii) the possible post-treatment effect of an increased spore load on surrounding vegetation. To study the first point, a Québec collection of 43 isolates of C. purpureum, from 14 different host species in 3 forest zones, and 92 isolates sampled from four Canadian geographical regions were analyzed using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) (Williams et al 1990). For the latter collection, samples were grouped into four populations each corresponding to a Canadian ecozone (ecozones 1, 2, 4 and 5) as defined in the Canadian registration guidelines for microbial pest control agents (Anonymous 1998). This grouping is based on geological and ecological characteristics. For the Québec population, RAPD profiles of all primer-template combinations (7 primers) were visually compared. Variability was initially assessed within and between different collection sites, for samples from a given host species. The genetic variation among samples isolated from different host species was then assessed, regardless of collection site. For Canadian populations, 22 polymorphic amplicons generated by 4 primers were analysed. Genetic diversity estimates (Nei 1973) and an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) (Huff et al. 1994) were used to investigate population structure. Finally, the occurrence of C. purpureum sporophores was assessed along eight 1.6km transects radiating from 4 treatment sites. Transects had sampling plots at 200m or 400m intervals. Over a 3-year period, over 10,000 trees, including paper birch, the most susceptible species, were surveyed. In addition, the presence of the fungus was examined in tissue samples from 220 stumps trees (paper birch, aspen and pin cherry) cut when environmental conditions were favorable for spore release from treatment sites. RAPD markers diagnostic of the deployed strains were also developed to determine if detected infections were attributable to the treatment (Gosselin 1999). C. purpureum was found to be a highly heterogeneous pathogen with a continuously distributed population across Canada (Gst = 0.048). A maximum of 0.3% of nontarget trees examined bore C. purpureum sporophores; a level corresponding to natural occurrence of the fungus. All sporophores were associated with either injured or recently killed trees, or with fresh stumps. A higher mean level of disease (15%) occurred on the 220 stumps sampled, infection levels varied from 0 to 45% between plots. However, RAPD analysis showed that over 85% of the infections detected were attributable to naturally occurring inoculum while less than 2.3% of the stumps contained deployed strains. The occurrence of infection was not related to host species or to distance from treated site. These results underscore the importance of considering the population structure in the process of its registration and provide further knowledge to ascertain that the deployment of C. purpureum as a bioherbicide may provide considerable benefits with minimal risks to the environment.', 'venue': '', 'year': 2010}\n",

It ranges from northeastern Minnesota eastward through southern Quebec, and from the southern Appalachian Mountains to northern Georgia and Alabama. This majestic tree is threatened with elimination by an invasive species Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (HWA) Adelges tsugae introduced in the USA in 1924, which is believed to be a native of Asia. HWA reduces shoot growth, provokes branch dieback, and eventually tree death. One strategy to help mitigate the fast spread of HWA is to determine what may cause host potential resistance to HWA and how to use this information to develop HWA-resistant management program. This project was initiated to.... To do that, randomly selected trees have been studied in Allegheny National Forest in 2006 with monthly data collection by hand-held soil probe instruments measuring temperature and water content noting the time of sampling and also some of them have been instrumented with station recording equipment called Hobo with recorders inserted at 15 cm soil depth and collecting temperature and water content data continuously. Net N mineralization and net nitrification were calculated using the in situ incubation technique, in this method the values of extractable nitrate-N and ammonium-N in incubated soil are compared to the initial. Exchangeable ammonia was extracted from air-dried soil samples that were sieved through a 2 mm sieve, using 2 M KCl in a 10:1 solution:soil ratio. Statistical analysis was conducted using SAS with data collected, the main effects were thinning treatment (reference, thinning), soil pH, soil organic matter percentage, tree DBH, soil temperature, sampling months. The thinning (treatment) is statistically significant (p= 0.053). The thinned plots mineralize more total nitrogen, almost 10 mg/kg of soil, approximately 50% than the reference plots. Thus, the observed N mineralization rate for the growing season was 21.7 mg/kg to 30 cm soil depth in control plots, or 65.8 kg N/ha. The estimated rate of N mineralization in HWA-infested stands was 30 times the observed rate, reaching 1973 kg/ha. A series of spatial prediction maps of the landscape Nitrogen levels were created by using ArcGIS 9.2 software that helped acquire a spatial perspective of the soil N mineralization rates in forest ecosystems at a large scale. These spatial prediction maps will become increasingly important once the HWA infests the study site and will be visible impacts of N mineralization rates change in forest soil. By creating a data base before HWA infestation of the stand and continuing gathering data after HWA infestation, with the help of the nitrogen mineralization model we will be able to elucidate the stand nutrient vs. HWA cause and effect relationship. Nitrogen forms are an important water quality parameter, but in excess, it can be detrimental to waterways and their ecosystems. Enriched nutrient loads to streams may alter surface water quality and disrupt management of watersheds used by municipal treatment water. Nitrate and cations diffusion into the surface water can reduce its drinking quality. Blue-baby syndrome (Methemoglobinemia) can be caused by high nitrate found in drinking waters.', 'venue': '', 'year': 2010}\n",

The Lidar sensor determines the distance and the position of an object, based on the time taken by a beam of light to reach the ground and to return to the sensor. Lidar has been successfully used in forestry studies because it results in a characterization of the structure of forest stands in three dimensions. Data collection is fast and non-intrusive. On the other hand, the fusion of Lidar data with multi-spectral data opens a large number of potential forestry applications because it provides information about the type of vegetation, the foliar density of trees, their phenology, as well as optical properties of certain species. The Financière Agricole de Québec (FADQ) in association with the Laboratoire de géomatique agricole et appliquée (GAAP), has used this technology to assess the yield and the quality of orchards in Québec. The present project aims at demonstrating the potential of Lidar and of multi-spectral data to show in 3D attributes of structure of individual apple trees such as the size of the crown and the estimation of the tree height. This then allows us to estimate the foliar biomass, the density of foliage and individual tree geo-positioning obtained by Lidar.

In the summer of 1982, Hans-Peter Schultze and Gloria Arratia were invited to a small museum located on a fossiliferous site of the Devonian Escuminac Formation in Miguasha, Quebec, eastern Canada, Hans-Peter was to work with Marius Arsenault, the director of the Miguasha Museum, on the skull of the elpistostegalid Elpistostege watsoni, a species closely related to basal tetrapod. In addition, he went through the collections to describe and measure numerous juvenile specimens of the osteolepiform. Eusthenopteran foordi. As expected, there two projects turned out to be important contributions in lower vertebrate paleontology and systematics: one on the origin of tetrapods (1985), and the second one on growth patterns of a Late Devonian fish (1984). During his visit to Miguasha, Hans-Peter also spent time digging for fossils and drawing numerous specimens in the collection. In addition, in order to help the personnel of the museum to identify some of the Escuminac fished, he created an identification key based on the gross morphology of the scales. For a small group of undergraduate students, hired at the museum during the summer as naturalists, it was a unique opportunity to discuss paleontology with a leading researcher. We were amazed by his willingness to talk to us, even if then most of us only spoke French! For the first time, we were exposed to Hennigian methodology and its usage in vertebrate paleontology during and evening lecture that Hans-Peter prepared for us. His lecture was delightful; it was an intensive course in lower vertebrate anatomy, and an intellectual journey among the philosophers Karl Marx and Karl Popper, the entomologists Willy Hennig and Lars Brundin, and \"The Band of Four\" (Rosen et al., 1981). It was for most of us our first exposure to science, as it should be done. We were all impressed by his knowledge and above all by his simplicity and friendliness. Two years later I started my Ph.D. at The University of Kansas, under the supervision of Hans-Peter. Compared to his long career, these two weeks that Hans-Peter spent in Miguasha represent an extremely shourt period of time. Some might say that this little anecdote is insignificant when introducing a vertebrate paleontologist (Fig. 1A) who published 132 paper and books (a total of 2977 published pages) in addition to more than 80 abstracts, book reviews and obituaries. However, this brief story is representative of Hans-Peter\\'s personality and contributions. He is a great scientist with numerous interests in science, art, and history. Hans-Peter enjoys digging for fossils, looking at fossils and describing fossils, and he loves sharing his knowledge and experiences with people, independent of their academic training. doi: 10.1002/mmng.20020050102', 'venue': '', 'year': 2002}\n",

A successful interdisciplinary effort must establish sufficient common grounds of reference to compare and contrast ideas. Energy Policy: The Global Challenge, unfortunately, does not. Some quirks of omission in this long, fine-print collection may be apparent to some readers. Although one author introduces two species of energy policies as \"provincialis\" and \"federalis,\" the theme of federal and provincial conflicts over energy receives little attention. This oversight is magnified when coupled with the significant bypassing of energy problems and prospects in eastern Canada. Hydro power in Newfoundland and Labrador, the political and economic gate-keeping by Quebec, offshore oil and gas, and tidal power developments in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia do not receive detailed consideration. Of course, this oversight may well be symptomatic of Canadian national energy policy and perceptions. Fusion energy is a technology cited by several authors as capable of dramatically offsetting their predictions of energy needs and resources. Yet, perceptions of the feasibility of fusion are, at best, unclear. An article by a reputable physicist in nontechnical terms would have been useful to the discussion. Although one or two authors mention hydrogen in passing, its potential for future contributions in increasing efficiency of Canadian energy systems was ignored.

Studies around the world have evaluated the succession of arthropods on animal carcasses, but no published data are available for the province of Quebec (Canada). The objective of this study was to evaluate the diversity of arthropods associated with pig carcasses in Quebec, and to determine the colonization sequence of the different families/species throughout the decomposition process. Three pig carcasses were deposited in a small woodland area in Trois-Rivières, in mid-June 2019. The decomposition process and the arthropod community were studied until the beginning of November (first snowfall) by visual observation, and sample collection on the carcasses, using an entomological net and pitfall traps. Five species of blow fly (Diptera: Calliphoridae) were found to lay eggs on the carcasses: Calliphora livida, C. vomitoria, Lucilia illustris, Phormia regina, and Protophormia terraenovae. Eggs/larvae of the first three species were recorded during the first week only (fresh stage-beginning of active decay), while the other two species were recorded throughout the decomposition process until the dry remains stage. Coleoptera were observed from day 0 to day 141 (end of experiment). Some families/species were associated with early stages of decomposition (e.g. Necrophila americana, Silphidae), while others were only found during the dry remains stage (e.g. Carnicops pumilio, Histeridae).', 2020, 9], ['10.3897/BDJ.8.e49450', 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9781c6ca0d288c9d6778ea9d9b8adfad3efa7046', 'Biodiversity Data Journal', 'The Odonata of Quebec: Specimen data from seven collections', \"Abstract Background The Odonata, dragonflies and damselflies, constitute one of the more charismatic and better-studied orders of insects. The approximately 6,000 extant species on Earth can be variously found on all continents, except Antarctica. A relatively stable taxonomy, a relative ease of species identification and an aquatic immature stage has made the Odonata a taxon of interest in documenting the symptoms of global environmental change, especially at higher latitudes. The Odonata fauna of the north-temperate Canadian province of Quebec includes 150 species, many of which are at the northern limits of their geographic distribution. New information Quebec hosts multiple entomological specimen depositories, including seven publicly-accessible research collections. One of these, the University of Montreal's Ouellet-Robert Entomological Collection, houses an exceptionally large collection of Odonata. An initial specimen data capture project for this collection gathered 31,595 Quebec Odonata occurrence records, but several Quebec species were missing and geographic coverage was biased towards the Montreal region. To complement this dataset, we undertook to digitise the Odonata records of six other public research collections. They are, in order of Quebec Odonata collection size, the Laval University Entomological Collection, McGill University's Lyman Entomological Museum, the Insectarium of Montreal Research Collection, the Quebec Government's Insect Collection, Bishop's University's Insect Collection and the Laurentian Forestry Centre's René-Martineau Insectarium. Of the 40,447 total specimen occurrence records, 36,951 are identified to the species level, including 137 of the 150 species officially-recorded in Quebec and 2 non-nominotypical subspecies. We here summarise the data and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the datasets.

The performance of S. planifolia stem cuttings collected in the Kuujjuaq area, northern Quebec, was evaluated in relation to sampling period, plant gender, exogenous auxin and nutrient concentration, rooting duration, watering frequency, and soil volume. Cuttings collected in August, during the active growing season, did not perform as well as those collected in June, October, or February. The only performance variables influenced by plant gender were root number and shoot biomass, for which female cuttings were superior to males. Surprisingly, the application of indole-3-butyric acid inhibited adventitious root and lateral shoot number and biomass, particularly at the highest concentration (10 000 mg·L -1 ). Increased nutrient availability enhanced root, but not shoot, growth. The best performance was observed when cuttings were grown in a relatively large soil volume (200 mL), watered frequently (twice a day), and allowed a relatively long period to root (70 days).', 1998, 9], ['10.1139/cjm-2015-0538', 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0eb39e0c8d1ddb80ae1d1792e8cb11622a64a09f', 'Canadian Journal of Microbiology (print)', 'Identification of Shigella flexneri isolates carrying the Shiga toxin 1-producing gene in Quebec, Canada, linked to travel to Haiti.', 'Shiga toxins (Stx1 and Stx2, also called verocytotoxins) are commonly associated with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and Shigella dysenteriae type 1 (Tesh and O’Brien 1991).

In the province of Quebec, more than 40% of Shigellosis cases are travel-related (Trepanier et al. 2014). Therefore, a retrospective laboratory study was performed by the Laboratoire de sante publique du Quebec to assess the presence of stx gene among the 210 strains of Shigella isolated between 2013 and 2014. The collection included 131 S. sonnei ,7 5S. flexneri ,3 S. boydii, and 1 S. dysenteriae type 12. Polymerase chain reaction targeting genes stx1 and stx2 was performed according to the methods of Paton and Paton (1998). Three isolates of S. flexneri isolated from stool were positive for the stx1 gene and belonged to serotype 2a (n = 2) and serotype y (n = 1). The amplified fragments were sequenced and identity was confirmed. Cases of shigellosis are systematically investigated as provincial regulations of notifiable diseases permits.

This research characterizes the regional distribution and abundance of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) near its northern range limit in northwestern Quebec, Canada, using a combination of remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS) analysis, and ground-based techniques. Although not regionally abundant, aspen is the main deciduous tree species in this conifer dominated landscape. Regionally, the ~51,200 km2 study area has few settlements or roads, and is without industrial activity that affects the land. Most of the region is inaccessible except by foot or water travel. We utilized Landsat Thematic Mapper images from 2010 and 2011, a robust collection of ground reference data developed from aerial photography, supported by field verification (vegetation sampling) where access permitted, to construct a thematic map of 11 land cover classes. The map highlights the spatial distribution of aspen, which represents only 0.3% of the study area. Map validation indicated an overall mapping accuracy of 74%, while the aspen predicted class was assessed at over 77% accurate. The regional scale distribution of aspen stands â‰¥ 0.5 ha within the study area shows two patterns: (1) a shift toward greatest abundance on south-facing aspects with increasing latitude; and (2) a highly clustered pattern that includes concentrations in areas of human disturbance. These patterns suggest that aspen range expansion due to climate-change related warming will vary with topographic and other microclimatic factors, i.e. be a function of climate change interacting with landscapes, and that anthropogenic disturbances have the potential to influence future aspen abundance independently of climate. Forest management policies concerned with changing forest composition in these northern landscapes should recognize the potentially important role of human activity in driving the abundance of aspen. \\n \\nKeywords: Boreal forest ecology, climate change, land cover classification, aspen, species distribution.', 2014, 9], ['10.5324/CJCR.V0I31.2531', 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/36e68ca8dec02c18c727cbd4e3ca655b539b103b', 'CHIRONOMUS Journal of Chironomidae Research', 'A new species in the Rheocricotopus (R.) effusus group from Canada with a review of the Nearctic species of Rheocricotopus and Parametriocnemus (Chironomidae: Orthocladiinae)', 'Rheocricotopus (Rheocricotopus) reduncusoides sp. n. is described from Bathurst Island, Nunavut, Canada.

Most difficult and/or unusual microorganisms, as well as commonly encountered microorganisms were selected, including Gram-positive and negative bacteria, mycobacteria, actinomycetes, yeasts and filamentous fungi. Six hundred forty two strains representing 159 genera and 441 species from clinical specimens previously identified at the Laboratoire de santé publique du Québec (LSPQ) by reference methods were retrospectively chosen for the study. They included 254 Gram-positive bacteria, 167 Gram-negative bacteria, 109 mycobacteria and aerobic actinomycetes and 112 yeasts and moulds.

New species described are Icriodella dicrana, Oulodus sigmoideus, Ozarkodina strena, and Pterospathodus? originalis. The fauna is dominated by species of Ozarkodina and Oulodus; many species have a first appearance that is slightly older than elsewhere suggesting that the Anticosti Basin may have been an important evolutionary radiative center in the early Silurian. There is a slow and progressive diversity increase in conodonts through this interval after the initial appearance of many new taxa in the basal Silurian following the mass extinction in the terminal Ordovician.

One basic premise of dendroclimatology is that tree rings can be viewed as climate proxies, i.e. rings are assumed to contain some hidden information about past climate. From a statistical perspective, this extraction problem can be understood as the search of a hidden variable which represents the common signal within a collection of tree-ring width series. Classical average-based techniques used in dendrochronology have been applied to estimate the mean behavior of this latent variable. Still, depending on tree species, regional factors and statistical methods, a precise quantification of uncertainties associated to the hidden variable distribution is difficult to assess. To model the error propagation throughout the extraction procedure, we propose and study a Bayesian hierarchical model that focuses on extracting an inter-annual high frequency signal.

However, a single female specimen identified by Hurd in 1954 as X. varipuncta Patton, 1879 from British Columbia is in the C.A. Triplehorn Insect Collection at The Ohio State University (OSUC), suggesting that this species was accidentally introduced into coastal western Canada. As wood-nesters, many large carpenter bees are likely capable of expanding their range great distances by natural and unnatural transport methods while nesting inside suitable substrates, the presumed mode of transport into western Canada, and likely elsewhere. The ease at which the nests are transported has likely contributed to the nomenclatural and distributional ambiguity surrounding this species due to morphological similarities of specimens from North America, Hawaii, and several South Pacific islands. New information By comparing DNA barcodes of specimens from the western United States to specimens from Hawaii, we confirm the early opinion of P.H. Timberlake (Timberlake 1922) that specimens long established on the Hawaiian Islands are the same X. varipuncta from continental North America. Furthermore, these DNA barcode sequences also match those of specimens identified as X. sonorina Smith, 1874 from the French Polynesian and Samoan Islands, thus fully supporting the opinion of Groom et al. (2017) that all are likely conspecific. As X. sonorina, a species described from and likely introduced to Hawaii is the oldest name available, X. varipuncta is here placed into synonymy. Additional research will be needed to trace the timing and pathway of introduction and establishment of X. sonorina; it is presumed that the species is native to the southwestern United States but has been established in Hawaii since the mid-1800s.

Sixty-two samples were collected from the Table Head and Long Point groups, western Newfoundland, the Jolliet Group, Anticosti Island, and the Trenton Group, St. Lawrence Lowlands. These yielded over 2600 moderately to well-preserved ostracodes. The Carter Collection, an existing collection of ostracodes from the Lowlands, was also examined. During the research, a series of difficulties were encountered in obtaining the faunas, interpreting their taxonomy, and understanding their paleoenvironmental implications. -- In the sections studied, Ordovician ostracodes occurred sporadically and were often rare or absent. All the collections were obtained by washing soft shales or by vibra-tool preparation of indurate limestones; selection of samples that can be readily processed is essential. Ordovician ostracode taxonomy is often confusing; many species are narrowly defined and allow little morphological variation. In this study, the taxonomy of a number of species is revised and a number of existing species are re-interpreted as synonyms. Fifty-four species representing forty genera are described and illustrated. No new species are established, because the current species are either already described in the literature, or could only be identified at the generic level because of a lack of well-preserved material. -- Although faunal composition, abundance and diversity arc directly influenced by the paleoenvironment, it is difficult to develop ostracode-based criteria for the elucidation of Ordovician paleoenvironments. Observations made during this study indicate that sea-level changes and water depth were strong controls on the nature of Ordovician ostracode faunas. In the Lourdes Formation, western Newfoundland and the Ellis Bay Formation, Anticosti Island, marked increases in faunal diversity and the rates of speciation can be directly correlated with transgressive events that increased the shelf area and the variety of niches available. Water depth, through its control of a variety of interdependent ecological factors, such as water temperature, food supply and substrate, was also an important influence on the type of ostracode community present. A series of depth-related communities are tentatively recognised. High- energy, nearshore environments tend to have a high-abundance, low-diversity fauna consisting of large, robust, smooth ostracodes; speciation rates are low and the community structure is relatively stable. Stable, open shelf, carbonate environments tend to have high-diversity faunas, consisting of a wide variety of ornamented forms such as Eurychilina subradiata and Foramenella phippsi; speciation rates are high and the community structure frequently changes. Outer shelf to shelf-slope environments tend to have a low-diversity, low-abundance fauna consisting of drepanellids such as Warthinia nodosa and smooth-elongate ostracodes like Phelobythocypris cylindrica; speciation rates are low and the community structure is stable. As depth increases and the shelf-slope transition is crossed, faunal abundance and diversity diminish rapidly and in situ ostracode faunas disappear altogether. -- Effective use of Ordovician ostracodes as biostratigraphic indicators, depends on their ability to cross facies and provincial boundaries. At present it is not possible to make more than crude correlations, because the faunas are not well enough known. A few of the species, such as Eurychilina subradiata and Tetradella quadrilirata, are wide ranging and have obvious potential for correlating Ordovician shelf sediments. Many other species cannot be used for inter- or intra-regional correlation, because they are locally endemic, occurring in some areas, but not in others.', 1991, 9], ['10.1017/S0031182017000117', 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/59b979d47398d5ff5b5db0800b7176e51443333f', 'Parasitology', 'Evaluating the submission of digital images as a method of surveillance for Ixodes scapularis ticks', 'SUMMARY Widespread access to the internet is offering new possibilities for data collection in surveillance.

In the case of this study, the impacts of elevation on parental plants and date of collection on seed germinability was determined for mature seeds of P. annua on three mountains in the Gaspesie National Park. Elevation as well as the date of collection did not influence germination of seeds of P. annua, and total germination remained very high (>80%) at high elevations.

Our overall goal was to test if soil perturbation and planting fast-growing species could promote the reestablishment of a relatively diverse plant community. A chronosequence that included three plantations (4, 8, and 12-year old) established after soil scarification, paired with three natural stands representative of the local temperate mixedwood forest comprising both pioneer and late-successional tree species, was implemented. Vegetation surveys and soil collection were performed in 2012 and species traits were provided by the Traits Of Plants In Canada and TRY databases. Principal response curve analyses showed species and functional trait divergence between treated and natural stands at ages 4 and 8, but that those divergences were less at age 12. Species and trait convergences were slower in the scarification furrows than in the scarification berms (mounds between furrows). However, severe site preparation did not appear to affect soil variables on the study sites. Our results suggest that even following severe site preparation, gradual recovery of species and trait composition similar to that of natural stands appears possible in the long term, mainly through fast canopy development by hybrid poplar. However, organic material export and soil erosion risks associated with this type of site preparation need to be evaluated.

The bacterial species identified (Paenibacillus, Klebsiella, Micrococcus, Microbacterium, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus and Stenotrophomonas) were similar to those found elsewhere in the world, including countries with much warmer climate than Canada (like China, India, and Egypt to name a few). This suggests that UEO as main carbon source -and not climateis determinant for the biodiversity on UEO collection sites. Many bacterial strains identified here resisted to exposure to UEO at higher concentration (20% v/v) than reported earlier. As observed in earlier reports for many bacteria under various growth conditions, bacteria screened from this UEO source were also able to produce an intracellular biopolymer that was identified as a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA). We also identified an interesting consortium (composed of Stenotrophomonas and Rhodococcus) that metabolized UEO alkanes, and appeared suitable for two applications: bioremediation and biopolymer production. Under specific conditions, this same bacterial consortium secreted an elastomer-like biopolymer. The biopolymer formed at the surface of broth cultures where it was easily recovered. Based on FTIR analyses, the biopolymer was tentatively identified as ethylene propylene diene monomer (an EPDM rubber). To our knowledge, the conversion of UEO into an extracellular elastomer by bacteria has not been previously reported.

Spangler (1961) reviewed the distribution and biology of S. tessellata, recording it from the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and Quebec as well as from localities throughout eastern United States. Smetana (1988), in his important review of the hydrophilidae of Canada, provides only three Canadian collection records for S. tessellata: one from Nova Scotia, one from Quebec and one from New Brunswick. roughley (1991) used Smetana’s review as the basis for a checklist of hydrophilidae of Canada, but gave the known Canadian distribution of S. tessellata as Nova Scotia, Quebec and Ontario instead of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Quebec. There are no Ontario specimens of S. tessellata in the Wallis-roughley Museum of Entomology (University of Manitoba) so roughley’s listing of Sperchopsis from Ontario was probably a lapsus. The relatively large (about 7 mm long), strikingly convex, pitted adults of this species are easily distinguished from other water scavenger beetles, so it is unlikely that it would be overlooked in collections or samples from aquatic insect surveys. The new Ontario records of Sperchopsis given below are based on the only known Ontario collections of the genus. I first collected and identified this species from Ontario in 1976, from the Credit river near Belfountain in Wellington County.

Although this turfgrass species has desirable playing attributes, it suffers from susceptibility to environmental and biological stresses including subfreezing temperatures and snow molds. In this study, we compared 29 genotypes collected from golf greens located in Quebec and Ontario for their resistance to pink snow mold (SM). Plants were inoculated with Microdochium nivale [(Fries) Samuels & Hallett], causal agent of SM, and incubated under controlled conditions. High levels of variation in SM resistance were detected within the collection and between genotypes. Analysis of the relationship between climatic parameters at the sites of origin and SM susceptibility revealed that level of resistance was positively correlated to the duration of snow cover. Genetic diversity within the Poa collection was estimated using the sequence related amplifi ed polymorphism (SRAP) technique. The UPGMA (unweighted-pair group method arithmetic average) dendrogram yielded two main clusters that differed markedly in their proportion of SM-resistant genotypes. Our results show that SM disease is a major selection pressure for the generation of genetic diversity among annual bluegrass biotypes that evolved on golf greens in northern climates. SRAP polymorphisms between bulked genotypes with contrasting resistance to SM were identifi ed and could be used as markers for SM resistance in annual bluegrass.', 2009, 9], ['10.1007/978-3-642-60160-6_7', 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/acf068e5f448f5ebef877f5acc1e7944abb74633', '', 'Mercury in Birds and Mammals', None, 1999, 9], ['10.1664/0028-7199(2001)109[0367:ATTCE]2.0.CO;2', 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cd5441636be2f137809dfc873a1bbdf7a5b1eae1', '', 'ADDITIONS TO THE CANADIAN EPHEMEROPTERA', 'Abstract New provincial distribution records are provided for 40 Ephemeroptera species in Canada based on the examination of specimens held in the Canadian National Collection of Insects.

Ex Fr.) Pouzar as a natural means of controlling vegetative regrowth from stumps of native hardwoods is receiving increased attention in Canada (Gosselin 1996, Dumal et al. 1997, Shamoun and Hintz 1998). The technique involves treating freshly cut stumps with the mycelium of indigenous strains of this ubiquitous fungus. However, the deployment of fungal plant pathogens with wide host-ranges may have certain undesirable environmental side effects. These negative impacts may be linked, among others, to the introduction of new genetic material to local genepools and to increased post-treatment spore load. In addressing both of these topics, we assessed: i) the extent of genetic variability among Canadian populations of C. purpureum both within and between different ecozones, and ii) the possible post-treatment effect of an increased spore load on surrounding vegetation. To study the first point, a Québec collection of 43 isolates of C. purpureum, from 14 different host species in 3 forest zones, and 92 isolates sampled from four Canadian geographical regions were analyzed using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) (Williams et al 1990). For the latter collection, samples were grouped into four populations each corresponding to a Canadian ecozone (ecozones 1, 2, 4 and 5) as defined in the Canadian registration guidelines for microbial pest control agents (Anonymous 1998). This grouping is based on geological and ecological characteristics. For the Québec population, RAPD profiles of all primer-template combinations (7 primers) were visually compared. Variability was initially assessed within and between different collection sites, for samples from a given host species. The genetic variation among samples isolated from different host species was then assessed, regardless of collection site. For Canadian populations, 22 polymorphic amplicons generated by 4 primers were analysed. Genetic diversity estimates (Nei 1973) and an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) (Huff et al. 1994) were used to investigate population structure. Finally, the occurrence of C. purpureum sporophores was assessed along eight 1.6km transects radiating from 4 treatment sites. Transects had sampling plots at 200m or 400m intervals. Over a 3-year period, over 10,000 trees, including paper birch, the most susceptible species, were surveyed. In addition, the presence of the fungus was examined in tissue samples from 220 stumps trees (paper birch, aspen and pin cherry) cut when environmental conditions were favorable for spore release from treatment sites. RAPD markers diagnostic of the deployed strains were also developed to determine if detected infections were attributable to the treatment (Gosselin 1999). C. purpureum was found to be a highly heterogeneous pathogen with a continuously distributed population across Canada (Gst = 0.048). A maximum of 0.3% of nontarget trees examined bore C. purpureum sporophores; a level corresponding to natural occurrence of the fungus. All sporophores were associated with either injured or recently killed trees, or with fresh stumps. A higher mean level of disease (15%) occurred on the 220 stumps sampled, infection levels varied from 0 to 45% between plots. However, RAPD analysis showed that over 85% of the infections detected were attributable to naturally occurring inoculum while less than 2.3% of the stumps contained deployed strains. The occurrence of infection was not related to host species or to distance from treated site. These results underscore the importance of considering the population structure in the process of its registration and provide further knowledge to ascertain that the deployment of C. purpureum as a bioherbicide may provide considerable benefits with minimal risks to the environment.', 2010, 9], ['10.33915/etd.4588', 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/050be8fa818f0c48c8b8e8420adc8c068adc21d2', '', 'Site characterization of hemlock stands at Allegheny National Forest', 'Site characterization of hemlock stands at Allegheny National Forest Daniel Farcas Eastern Hemlock Tsuga canadensis is a coniferous tree native to eastern North America. It ranges from northeastern Minnesota eastward through southern Quebec, and from the southern Appalachian Mountains to northern Georgia and Alabama. This majestic tree is threatened with elimination by an invasive species Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (HWA) Adelges tsugae introduced in the USA in 1924, which is believed to be a native of Asia. HWA reduces shoot growth, provokes branch dieback, and eventually tree death. One strategy to help mitigate the fast spread of HWA is to determine what may cause host potential resistance to HWA and how to use this information to develop HWA-resistant management program. This project was initiated to.... To do that, randomly selected trees have been studied in Allegheny National Forest in 2006 with monthly data collection by hand-held soil probe instruments measuring temperature and water content noting the time of sampling and also some of them have been instrumented with station recording equipment called Hobo with recorders inserted at 15 cm soil depth and collecting temperature and water content data continuously. Net N mineralization and net nitrification were calculated using the in situ incubation technique, in this method the values of extractable nitrate-N and ammonium-N in incubated soil are compared to the initial. Exchangeable ammonia was extracted from air-dried soil samples that were sieved through a 2 mm sieve, using 2 M KCl in a 10:1 solution:soil ratio. Statistical analysis was conducted using SAS with data collected, the main effects were thinning treatment (reference, thinning), soil pH, soil organic matter percentage, tree DBH, soil temperature, sampling months. The thinning (treatment) is statistically significant (p= 0.053). The thinned plots mineralize more total nitrogen, almost 10 mg/kg of soil, approximately 50% than the reference plots. Thus, the observed N mineralization rate for the growing season was 21.7 mg/kg to 30 cm soil depth in control plots, or 65.8 kg N/ha. The estimated rate of N mineralization in HWA-infested stands was 30 times the observed rate, reaching 1973 kg/ha. A series of spatial prediction maps of the landscape Nitrogen levels were created by using ArcGIS 9.2 software that helped acquire a spatial perspective of the soil N mineralization rates in forest ecosystems at a large scale. These spatial prediction maps will become increasingly important once the HWA infests the study site and will be visible impacts of N mineralization rates change in forest soil. By creating a data base before HWA infestation of the stand and continuing gathering data after HWA infestation, with the help of the nitrogen mineralization model we will be able to elucidate the stand nutrient vs. HWA cause and effect relationship. Nitrogen forms are an important water quality parameter, but in excess, it can be detrimental to waterways and their ecosystems. Enriched nutrient loads to streams may alter surface water quality and disrupt management of watersheds used by municipal treatment water. Nitrate and cations diffusion into the surface water can reduce its drinking quality. Blue-baby syndrome (Methemoglobinemia) can be caused by high nitrate found in drinking waters.', 2010, 9], ['', 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6f53caa5631e64cfb6d2edcb388cd89831f03584', '', 'Application du Lidar aéroporté pour la caractérisation des vergers', 'During the last twenty years, large technological advances in active airborne remote sensing have allowed its application to the forest and agricultural sectors. The Lidar sensor determines the distance and the position of an object, based on the time taken by a beam of light to reach the ground and to return to the sensor. Lidar has been successfully used in forestry studies because it results in a characterization of the structure of forest stands in three dimensions. Data collection is fast and non-intrusive. On the other hand, the fusion of Lidar data with multi-spectral data opens a large number of potential forestry applications because it provides information about the type of vegetation, the foliar density of trees, their phenology, as well as optical properties of certain species. The Financière Agricole de Québec (FADQ) in association with the Laboratoire de géomatique agricole et appliquée (GAAP), has used this technology to assess the yield and the quality of orchards in Québec. The present project aims at demonstrating the potential of Lidar and of multi-spectral data to show in 3D attributes of structure of individual apple trees such as the size of the crown and the estimation of the tree height. This then allows us to estimate the foliar biomass, the density of foliage and individual tree geo-positioning obtained by Lidar. The results of the tree counting and apple production estimations are compared with field data and with statistics from FADQ.

In the summer of 1982, Hans-Peter Schultze and Gloria Arratia were invited to a small museum located on a fossiliferous site of the Devonian Escuminac Formation in Miguasha, Quebec, eastern Canada, Hans-Peter was to work with Marius Arsenault, the director of the Miguasha Museum, on the skull of the elpistostegalid Elpistostege watsoni, a species closely related to basal tetrapod. In addition, he went through the collections to describe and measure numerous juvenile specimens of the osteolepiform. Eusthenopteran foordi. As expected, there two projects turned out to be important contributions in lower vertebrate paleontology and systematics: one on the origin of tetrapods (1985), and the second one on growth patterns of a Late Devonian fish (1984). During his visit to Miguasha, Hans-Peter also spent time digging for fossils and drawing numerous specimens in the collection. In addition, in order to help the personnel of the museum to identify some of the Escuminac fished, he created an identification key based on the gross morphology of the scales. For a small group of undergraduate students, hired at the museum during the summer as naturalists, it was a unique opportunity to discuss paleontology with a leading researcher. We were amazed by his willingness to talk to us, even if then most of us only spoke French! For the first time, we were exposed to Hennigian methodology and its usage in vertebrate paleontology during and evening lecture that Hans-Peter prepared for us. His lecture was delightful; it was an intensive course in lower vertebrate anatomy, and an intellectual journey among the philosophers Karl Marx and Karl Popper, the entomologists Willy Hennig and Lars Brundin, and \"The Band of Four\" (Rosen et al., 1981). It was for most of us our first exposure to science, as it should be done. We were all impressed by his knowledge and above all by his simplicity and friendliness. Two years later I started my Ph.D. at The University of Kansas, under the supervision of Hans-Peter. Compared to his long career, these two weeks that Hans-Peter spent in Miguasha represent an extremely shourt period of time. Some might say that this little anecdote is insignificant when introducing a vertebrate paleontologist (Fig. 1A) who published 132 paper and books (a total of 2977 published pages) in addition to more than 80 abstracts, book reviews and obituaries. However, this brief story is representative of Hans-Peter\\'s personality and contributions. He is a great scientist with numerous interests in science, art, and history. Hans-Peter enjoys digging for fossils, looking at fossils and describing fossils, and he loves sharing his knowledge and experiences with people, independent of their academic training. doi: 10.1002/mmng.20020050102', 2002, 9], ['10.1017/S0008423900035770', 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/04059dec4db00b05bd45dadf2bd3b33258d30826', 'Canadian Journal of Political Science/Revue canadienne de science politique', 'A Northern Foreign Policy Franklyn Griffiths Toronto: Canadian Institute of International Affairs, 1979, pp. 90', 'promote conservation. Within this sequence there lurks a tendency to move from prophetic overviews to empirically based modelling to policy implementation, but disparate assumptions by the individual authors give the reader the feeling of participating in a form of energy leap-frog. A successful interdisciplinary effort must establish sufficient common grounds of reference to compare and contrast ideas. Energy Policy: The Global Challenge, unfortunately, does not. Some quirks of omission in this long, fine-print collection may be apparent to some readers. Although one author introduces two species of energy policies as \"provincialis\" and \"federalis,\" the theme of federal and provincial conflicts over energy receives little attention. This oversight is magnified when coupled with the significant bypassing of energy problems and prospects in eastern Canada. Hydro power in Newfoundland and Labrador, the political and economic gate-keeping by Quebec, offshore oil and gas, and tidal power developments in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia do not receive detailed consideration. Of course, this oversight may well be symptomatic of Canadian national energy policy and perceptions. Fusion energy is a technology cited by several authors as capable of dramatically offsetting their predictions of energy needs and resources. Yet, perceptions of the feasibility of fusion are, at best, unclear. An article by a reputable physicist in nontechnical terms would have been useful to the discussion. Although one or two authors mention hydrogen in passing, its potential for future contributions in increasing efficiency of Canadian energy systems was ignored.
