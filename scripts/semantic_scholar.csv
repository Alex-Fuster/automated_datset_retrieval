Forest growth simulators usually include recruitment models. The quality of recruitment predictions can have long-term impacts on estimations of forest growth, ecosystem health and the commercial utility of managed forests. The main objective of this study was to develop a recruitment model for commercial-size trees (i.e., trees with a diameter at breast height [DBH] > 9 cm) of 10 species groups using different dendrometric and environmental variables. The resulting model will be included in a growth simulator used to support forest management planning. We hypothesized that accounting for sapling density as a covariate would improve the recruitment model’s predictive performance. Using empirical data from periodically measured permanent sample plots (1982–2019) located throughout the managed mixed hardwood forests of Quebec, we constructed models with and without sapling-related covariates and compared them on the basis of cross-validation model performance statistics. Our results show that including sapling density significantly improved model performance. From this, we conclude that adding sapling density as a covariate can significantly improve a recruitment model’s predictive power for eastern mixed hardwood forests.;2022;10;semantic_scholar

The random encounter model (REM) is a camera‐trap method that has been developed to estimate population densities using unmarked individuals. However, few studies have evaluated its reliability in the field, especially considering that this method relies on parameters obtained from collared animals (i.e., average speed, in km/h), which can be difficult to acquire at low cost and effort. Our objectives were to (1) assess the reliability of this camera‐trap method and (2) evaluate the influence of parameters coming from different populations on density estimates. We estimated a reference density of black bears (Ursus americanus) in Forillon National Park (Québec, Canada) using a spatial capture–recapture estimator based on hair‐snag stations. We calculated average speed using telemetry data acquired from four different bear populations located outside our study area and estimated densities using the REM. The reference density, determined with a Bayesian spatial capture–recapture model, was 2.87 individuals/10km2 [95% CI: 2.41–3.45], which was slightly lower (although not significatively different) than the different densities estimated using REM (ranging from 4.06–5.38 bears/10km2 depending on the average speed value used). Average speed values obtained from different populations had minor impacts on REM estimates when the difference in average speed between populations was low. Bias in speed values for slow‐moving species had more influence on REM density estimates than for fast‐moving species. We pointed out that a potential overestimation of density occurs when average speed is underestimated, that is, using GPS telemetry locations with large fix‐rate intervals. Our study suggests that REM could be an affordable alternative to conventional spatial capture–recapture, but highlights the need for further research to control for potential bias associated with speed values determined using GPS telemetry data.;2021;10;semantic_scholar

Carabid beetles were sampled in six to seven fields from June to September 2004 and 2005 using pitfall traps. A total of 33 species from 15 genera were identified, with the exotic Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger) (Coleoptera: Carabidae), representing 75.8% and 84.5% of all individuals trapped in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Large variations in species richness and diversity indexes were observed between fields within and between years. Multivariate analyses showed that carabid activity-density varied as a function of field location and sampling period, with individuals belonging to species overwintering as adults being more abundant early in the growing season. There was no relationship between carabid trap catches and A. glycines density, suggesting that carabid beetles do not respond numerically to soybean aphid populations at the spatial scale studied.

However, detailed population dynamics studies are hard to conduct in low-density, pre-outbreak populations because the insects are difficult to sample in sufficient numbers. Using laboratory-raised larvae installed in the field across a 1,000 km east-west gradient in Québec (Canada) over an 11-yr period, we examined if parasitism and predation were likely to explain fluctuations in low-density spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana; SBW) populations. Parasitism rates by the two main larval parasitoid species, Elachertus cacoeciae and Tranosema rostrale, peaked during different years. This suggests that temporal fluctuations in overall parasitism were partly buffered by compensatory dynamics among parasitoid species. Still, spatial covariance analyses indicate that the residual interannual variation in parasitism rates was substantial and correlated over large distances (up to 700 km). On the other hand, interannual variation in predation rates was not spatially correlated. Piecewise structural equation models indicate that temporal variation in parasitism and predation does not influence temporal variation in wild SBW abundance. Spatially, however, SBWs installed in warmer locations tended to show higher parasitism rates, and these higher rates correlated with lower wild SBW population levels. Overall, the results indicate that large-scale drops in parasitism occur and could potentially contribute to SBW population increases. However, during the period covered by this study, other factors such as direct effects of weather on SBW larval development or indirect effects through host tree physiology or phenology were more likely to explain large-scale variation in wild SBW populations.";2018;10;semantic_scholar

The unusual association of the tabulate coral Procteria (Pachyprocteria) with the “worm” Hicetes is pointed out.

Results show that wood density differences exist between populations and that wood density is negatively correlated with the width of the growth rings; however, some trees and some populations exhibit both high wood density and rapid growth. A moderate positive link was found between juvenile and mature wood densities at both the individual and population levels. Therefore, breeding programs for the improvement of wood density could be based on selections made on juvenile wood.";1987;10;semantic_scholar

Since their introduction on Anticosti Island (Québec) in the late 1890s, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have had detrimental effects on preferred forage species. To determine the impact of deer browsing on tree growth and forest structure, we compared stem density, age, and size of conifer species across a range of open, semi-forested, and forest stands, where browsing severity on balsam fir (Abies balsamea), a preferred species, was variable. Most balsam fir saplings showed signs of browsing, with maximum impact at low sapling density. At most stands, balsam fir saplings were smaller than white spruce (Picea glauca) and black spruce (Picea mariana) saplings and developed bonsai-like growth forms. Browsing was light on white spruce; no browsing was recorded on black spruce. Tree-ring analysis was used to differentiate the influence of deer browsing from the possible effects of past insect activity on conifer species. Periods of radial growth reduction coincided with documented spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) and hemlock looper (Lambdina fiscellaria) infestations during the 20th century. The combined influence of insect defoliation and deer browsing on fir was evidenced by contrasted patterns in stem growth above and below browsing height. Balsam fir sapling mortality in the 1980s and early 1990s was likely due to severe deer browsing rather than insect defoliation. Reduced sapling growth and recruitment of balsam fir to the canopy will likely modify the forest composition from balsam fir- to white spruce-dominated stands.";2005;10;semantic_scholar

Under humid climate, used covers are mainly oxygen barrier covers. Their performance is based on the maintenance of a high level of water saturation in cover layers that decreases oxygen ingress down to reactive mine wastes. After mine closure, natural colonisation of plant species adapted to current climate conditions takes place gradually on the covers. Plants, especially trees with deep rooting, can affect the water balance of the cover materials. If water saturation decreases in cover materials due to root colonisation, it can cause oxygen ingress to the mine wastes. Numerical models used to predict cover water balance integrate vegetation effects mainly through the use of leaf area index (LAI), root maximal depth (Rtmax), and root length density (RLD) as input parameters. By 2100, a northward shift of the distribution of some tree species is predicted from temperate to boreal regions of Canada because of climate change (CC). 
In this paper, the Lorraine abandoned mine site reclaimed with a cover with capillary barrier effect (CCBE) and surrounded by a boreal mixed wood forest was used as a case study. CC projections, woody species inventories, and bibliographical research of tree species distribution changes and associated values of key parameters were conducted. All the information collected, along with CC projection data, has helped anticipate potential effects on cover water balance components in the context of CC for the Quebec region. At the Lorraine mine site, future dominance of shallow- and medium-rooted deciduous tree species and decline of shallow- and deep-rooted coniferous tree species with CC will have impacts on the CCBE water balance. Further insights are needed to model and integrate potential effects of CC on the evolution of LAI, Rtmax and RLD values of shallow-, medium- and deep-rooted species when assessing the efficiency of mine reclamation cover design over the long term. Preventive and/or remedial measures may be required to prevent cover performance decrease due to tree colonisation.";2019;10;semantic_scholar

It is associated with aegirine, annite, galena, a labuntsovite-group mineral, manganoneptunite, microcline, pyrrhotite, sodalite and zircon. Paragenetically, the mineral crystallizes after aegirine and before microcline. Isolated, single crystals are colorless to grey, prismatic along [001], and slightly flattened perpendicular to this direction, with a maximum dimension of 0.1 × 0.25 mm. It develops as euhedral crystals displaying the prominent forms prism {100} and pinacoid {001}, with a minor, very shallow ditrigonal scalenohedron {10 l }. The mineral is transparent with a vitreous luster and a white streak and is non-luminescent. The Mohs hardness is 5, and no cleavage is evident. It is brittle with a conchoidal to splintery fracture. The calculated density is 3.34 g/cm 3 . Rogermitchellite is non-pleochroic, uniaxial positive, with ω 1.640(1) and e 1.663(1). Four analyses made on one crystal gave, as an average: Na 2 O 3.45, CaO 0.10, SrO 18.54, BaO 5.18, B 2 O 3 (calc.) 2.34, SiO 2 39.12, ZrO 2 26.39, TiO 2 0.63 and H 2 O (calc.) 6.96, for a total of 102.71 wt.%.

The strongest six lines on the X-ray powder-diffraction pattern [ d in A(I)( hkl )] are: 2.760(100)(442), 3.761(90)(402), 1.991(70)(444), 3.150(50)(441), 5.762(40)(400) and 3.924(30)(312). The crystal structure was refined to R = 4.62% and w R 2 = 12.73% for 1588 reflections [ F o > 4σ( F o )]. It consists of pairs (Si 3 O 9 ) rings (offset 30° relative to one another along [001]) linked to isolated ZrO 6 octahedra in a motif similar to that in benitoite. Additional (Si 3 O 9 ) and [Si 2 BO 7 (OH) 2 ] rings along with ZrO 6 octahedra complete a three-dimensional heteropolyhedral framework. Channels along [001] within this framework are occupied by Ba, Na, (Sr + Na) and H 2 O. Rogermitchellite has chemical and crystal-structure features common to benitoite, wadeite and catapleiite, and should be considered as a structural hybrid of these minerals. It possesses additional features (presence of essential B, Sr, H 2 O; trigonal symmetry) that make it unique.";2010;10;semantic_scholar
