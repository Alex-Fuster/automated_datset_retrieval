ABSTRACT

*Aim*
Effective management strategies for conserving biodiversity and mitigating the impacts of Global Change rely on access to comprehensive and up-to-date biodiversity data. However, manual search, retrieval, evaluation, and integration of this information into databases presents a significant challenge to keep pace with the rapid influx of large amounts of data, hindering its utility in contemporary decision-making processes. The automation of these tasks through advanced algorithms holds immense potential to revolutionize biodiversity monitoring.

*Innovation*
In this study, we investigate the potential for automating the retrieval and evaluation of biodiversity data from Driad and Zenodo repositories. We employ automated algorithms to identify potentially relevant datasets and perform a manual assessment to gauge the feasibility of automatically ranking their relevance. We have designed an evaluation system based on various criteria. Additionally, we compare our results with those obtained from a scientific literature source, using data from Semantic Scholar for reference. Our evaluation centers on the database utilized by a national biodiversity monitoring system in Quebec, Canada.

*Main clonclusions*
Using simple search queries, the automated algorithms retrieved 161 datasets, from which 91 (57%) were relevant for our database. However, our manual evaluation highlights a significant challenge to distinguish them by their relevanceâ€”scarcity and non-uniform distribution of metadata, especially pertaining to spatial and temporal extents. Additionally, we find that scientific publication sources offer a significantly broader temporal coverage compared to repositories and can serve as conduits guiding researchers toward other valuable data sources. Our study underscores the importance of designing specialized retrieval strategies for distinct data sources, presents an evaluative framework based on predefined criteria that can be adopted by automated algorithms for streamlined prioritization, and calls for the establishment of a global standardized framework to incorporate metadata in a format tailored for automated retrieval systems. Elevating our commitment to developing these aspects holds transformative potential to advance in biodiversity monitoring, gain deeper understanding of biodiversity dynamics, and decisively steering the course of well-informed decision-making processes.
